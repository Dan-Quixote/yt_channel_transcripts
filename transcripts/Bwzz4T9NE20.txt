what's going on everybody just a real quick hitter today wanted to quickly go over intense scoping in voice flow because I was just working on a project and I came across an issue that's not super obvious when you're first learning a voice flow and when you're going through a lot of the tutorials so I'll just show you what I mean real quick we'll start this flow from here uh we're not going to worry too much about what's actually going on it's mostly just intense scoping and how the conversation can sometimes route ways you don't want so it's asking for an email address in this case to check the status of an order I'm going to put in this particular email address which is triggering the intent so basically what happens here is that we're checking the St the status of an order and it asks for an email I put in my email address and then for whatever reason this join Rewards program intent thinks that I want to join the rewards program and instead of checking my order status it jumps me completely out of that flow and starts me down this join Rewards program flow so obviously that would be a bad user experience if that actually happened to a customer so the way to fix this is to go back to the capture step where we were capturing the email you'll select it and we just want to capture the email we don't want to look anywhere else for any other intents we don't want to listen for any anything else going on we just want to capture the email so you'll click the step you'll click this little settings go to intense scoping and instead of listening for all intents you only want to listen for intents in this step which are actually there's no intents in this step listed we're just capturing the email and saving it to a variable that's all we're doing so we change that we'll run this again just to make sure it works good so we're getting the order information the order status to pull through now you can see it did still detect that intent uh I can troubleshoot that didn't figure out why it's picking up that intent from this email it doesn't make too much sense to me at first glance but even so even though it picked up the intent it didn't transfer me to a whole different part of the flow it just continued down this flow and retrieved the order information which is exactly what we want so that's it for this video just a real quick hitter on how you can fix this fairly common but frustrating issue if you haven't seen it before and know how to fix it so it's what I wanted to go over thank you for watching
