what is going on guys my name is Rob win from volt.com and today I going to be showing you how you can use voice flow to create an automated customer service agent for your business whether you're a business owner whether you're an agency owner like me and you're creating this for someone else or if you just want to get the lay of the land with voice flow and figure out what's going on this video is going to be for you let's get right into it all right so here we are on the voiceflow dashboard now before we get fully into creating the chatbot I quickly wanted to go over the difference between using voice flow to create your agents and using something like chatbase because I know when I first got into it I was a little confused on what the difference was between those two basically with chat base it has the ability where you can upload a knowledge Source or a knowledge base and you can create very easily a question and answer chatbot just strictly simple question and answering it's great for that and it's very simple and easy to use but it can't do much more than that it can't really perform actions it can't integrate with outside sources update databases retrieve order information make API calls all that more complicated stuff that's what you'll want to use a service like voice flow for and there are others like bot press this tutorial is going to be focused on Voice Low it's the one I've used and I found it very easy to use intuitive and beginner friendly so with that quick note out of the way we will proceed with the creation of the agent here this is the dashboard like I said in order to get to this screen you'll obviously want to sign up create an account do all that there is no charge for using voice flow they do have a free plan you don't even need to put in a credit card you get two agents with that plan for free and up to 100,000 tokens per month so uh highly recommend it if you just want to try it out there is an affiliate Link in the description if you feel like doing that if not no worries at all but I'll wait for you to get it set up and get to the screen and then we will proceed by clicking the new agent button in the top right to start our our agent we'll go ahead and click that there go ahead and fill out these fields here with the appropriate things we'll just do a chat bot although there is the option for voice chat we'll hit continue it's going to ask for what authorize users we want we'll just leave that the way it's set right now then we'll hit create agent to bring us to the canvas for our new agent so here we are on the default canvas it sort of gives you a basic template for uh an agent I do actually encourage you to play around with this for a little bit just to see how it works like I said voice flow is pretty intuitive and beginner friendly so you can learn a lot just by playing around with the stuff seeing how the flows work seeing how the different boxes and actions work and maybe experimenting and try adding a few things yourself so I do encourage you to pause the video and just play around with this for now we will proceed you can select all items by clicking shift and then dragging your cursor it'll select everything and then we'll just go ahead and hit delete to delete everything to start with a fresh canvas so as you can see now we have the Simple Start trigger this is going to be the start of our flow anytime an interaction or a chat starts with our agent this is where it's going to start from and in order CH add things to this flow you can click this little button here and drag like this or you can go over here and you can come to this menu and you can click and drag the appropriate things as well we're going to start with the basic um message block this is the default me this is the default block if you just want to have your agent say something to the user you can click within it and then enter your agent message here so we're just going to have something really basic a greeting welcoming the user to our site something like that we'll do hello welcome to our website that sounds solid and then you can actually stack multiple things within a block you can see you can put it above below like that we'll put this one below and it'll just be a what can I help you with message to get the conversation going we'll want to link up our start trigger with this block so when we click Start it goes to this and now now we're actually going to run it and see what happens and you can see we've got our two separate messages there if I had just put all the text into one block it would have just been one line of code but you can break it up into multiple messages if you think that looks better for your use case and then it just ends you can see sess session ended because there's nothing else going on here we haven't prompted the user to input anything or anything like that now a quick note on testing I just want to say you should be testing your agents early and often test them as much as possible to make sure that they are doing exactly what you want them to that's very important so that you don't go through a whole bunch of steps only to find out when you test it at the end that it's not working the way you want to so be sure to test often you do have to keep an eye on your token you should sometimes because testing does use tokens but there's ways you can manage that so it doesn't use as many tokens when you're testing uh and you can still make make sure that it's doing exactly what you want so just a quick note on that so now in order to actually listen for a response from the user that's where this listen step comes in over here it means just listen wait and listen for the user to say something basically and you got three options you got buttons choice and capture buttons and choice are basically basically the same thing they both allow the user to free flow type things in just in plain English how they want it's just with buttons you also give some visual literal visual buttons that the user can click on in addition to them having the ability to type something out so those two are very similar and then capture just means whatever the user replies we're going to capture that and save it to a variable that's what that means so in this case we're going to Simply choose choice and just let the user say whatever ever they want we're going to click and drag it here and by the way just so you're aware voice flow is frequently doing updates so if you're watching this video in the future and things aren't named exactly the way that they are here or the layout's a little different don't freak out it was the same way for me when I was watching the tutorials for me to learn uh just it might take a minute to figure out the new thing but it's usually very similar and like I said pretty easy to understand so now we've got our capture block here and you can see it says listening for an intent so what does an intent mean it means basically what it says it's it's what is the user intending to do or what are they what are they trying to do now you actually as the voice flow Creator have to set this up and tell voice flow what the possible intents are there's not just an INF infinite number of them you have to specify exactly which intents you want it to listen for so if we run this test again we've got the two messages and then it does it doesn't end it does wait for us to type something but if we say something like I need text support and send that message in we get this sorry I didn't get that message and that's because we haven't configured any intents yet for it to actually listen to so there it can't really Define what the user says and fit it into a specific category it can only respond with this message no matter what we said so if we said in even we get the exact same response so to solve that what we want to do is start creating some intents and to do that you go ahead and click on this you'll go over here to select an intent for One path there's some default intents here just yes and no we'll create a new intent we'll call it Tex support like I just typed in you can type a description as well if you want and then these utterances These are what where you specify things that the user might say that are you want to direct to this intent so obviously what I just said I need text support that would be one you can hit enter I need help with my software would be another and then what you can do is use this AI generation tool by clicking here you can generate some sample phrases and it'll come up with a bunch for you that are similar IL to the first one that you put in here it's always going to go by the very first one now you do want to double check these because sometimes they're not exactly what you want so don't just click that and call it a day because the green confidence bar is full you do want to quickly go over that to make sure your agent is routing them appropriately so if you don't want any you can just click this negative sign and it'll take them away also what I recommend doing here is if you have like a user might say multiple different things and you all wanted to Route it to the same intent because the AI here can only generate based on that first one that you says or said you can just use chat gbt or another large language model for help generating a bunch of utterances that the user might say can also do it where you know yall know people don't always type say things exactly the way you would say them people uh misspell words there's people who your native language isn't there native language so they they type things with incorrect grammar stuff like that you can also instruct chat gbt to give you some of those utterances uh you want to have a good variety uh a good coverage of the different things people could say to make sure you're getting it everything to the right intent and this is a thing another thing that takes a lot of testing to make sure you're getting it right so again with these do you want to make sure through tests that you want to try a variety of different ways of saying the same thing to make sure it is correctly routing to the intent but for now we're just going to go with these we'll assume all these look good for our purposes in this tutorial they do we'll click create intent and now we can see our tech support intent filled or populates that path over there and now when we run our test let's take a look oh actually first we need to go ahead and train our model that's what when you see this little red dot it means the agent needs training this usually happens when you you modify your intents or potentially the knowledge base it says it may take a few minutes but I've never seen it take more than like 20 seconds so it's really not too bad see it's already trained now we can proceed we'll say I need text support I need text support just like before now this time the session does end and it says no intent matched but actually you can see here now we do have text support at 100% And that tech support is an indicator of the intent that we set up it is matching to the TCH support intent with 100% confidence and a way to get this figure up if you don't see it on your screen is to click this little settings button for the test and go into debug mode and then show the intent confidence score as well I think this is clicked off by default yeah you can see It'll show show up when we when we click it there so I highly recommend both of those just for troubleshooting purposes and also I want to show you this tab real quick over on the left if you click this little bar it'll pop out with all the variables and their current values as you go through the test that can be very helpful as well for debugging so now that our agent in this step is listening for intense and we have the text support setup or in tech support intent setup what do we want to have happen when someone we detect that intent that's where we can click the little circle and drag and then create a path from here now for this tutorial we're just going to create make it real simple and just create a message that says it's going to trigger the text support process but obviously for when you're creating your own bonds you can build this out however you want uh you can if you get into the more complicated stuff which we will a little bit later I'll show you how to use make.com Integrations to integrate with the agent here you can create tickets use zenes that sort of thing but for now we'll just leave it at this so we can move on with the tutorial now in order to create additional intents cuz obviously there's other things besides tech support that a user might want to do you can go ahead and click add Choice here by going back to the listen button click add choice and you'll have the option to add another intent and you can do this pretty much as many times as you want we'll go ahead and create a new intent here we'll do billing do the same thing where we create some sample UT utterances and use the generate function to populate a bunch and we'll go ahead and create that intent as well so we have two intents up and running I'll create a simple path for this one just for completeness and a quick note on intent confidence score we saw before when we did the test run it was 100% confident that what we said would go to the tech support intent but often it's not that it might only be 60% sure 80% sure you can adjust that setting so that the I think the the confidence threshold by default is 60% if it's 60% for sure 60% sure you want to go to a particular intent it will route it that way but you can adjust that 50 you want it to be more confident 80 90 something like that just a quick note on the confidence threshold so one other quick thing with intents I wanted to show you is the trigger function and if you right click on the canvas and you click this button called add trigger you'll get a button like this similar to the start button but for this one it's going to connect to an intent so if you click on it and then you click the little plus sign by triggers you'll see a list of intents here and you can click one and what this means is if it detects an intent it will route to this so this can be an alternative to adding the path directly from here like we could say instead of that we could have have it go to this action and go to intent and then we can select this intent under home and then text support and it'll route here now one thing about these triggers you have to keep in mind is that they will listen globally in the conversation so in another part of the conversation like way down in your workflow if it detects that the user wants text support this will listen for it and it will pick it up and it'll route and it'll start over here so that's something to keep in mind when using these triggers but I'll go ahead and delete this I just wanted to point it out because that is another option you can use in your workflows all right now what if the user inputs something that is not tech support or billing what if they have a question about our services or what our prices are or anything about our business that's where the knowledge base and the actual AI portion of the flow can come in so we'll go ahead and click on this Choice box and then for no match basically saying it doesn't match any of the intents what do we want to have happen we'll click on that and then we'll click path here to allow us the option to create a different path for when there is no match and then we can click the little circle drag it and now we have what's going to happen when they ask let's just say what happens when they ask what services we offer that's where we'll click and drag and we want the AI to answer that question so we click this there's two options under AI there's set Ai and response AI response AI is where you are responding to the user's question which we'll use here set AI is where you're going to use AI to set variables similar to the listen step where we captured the user response and set it to a variable set AI we're going to be taking the AI response and setting saving that to variables but for now we actually just want to directly respond to the user's question so we'll click response AI and then we have two options for our data source when we do that we have just the basic AI model and everything it was trained on all the information on the web that sort of thing and then we have knowledge base which is the custom information specific to your business it's basically what it sounds like it's a base of knowledge maybe some frequently asked questions some information about your business anything you would want to possibly convey to a user using this agent here you could put into your knowledge base and the way that it works is if you're if you're familiar with the concept of a vector database that's essentially what it is it'll break down all the knowledge into vectors and score it and then based on the user's query the model will retrieve the relevant parts of the knowledge base to answer the user's question so it's not like it's sending the entire knowledge Place base plus the user's question to the large language model and getting the response in order to be practical and save tokens it can figure out what are the most relevant sections or chunks as they're called of the knowledge base extract those then send those chunks plus the user's question as the prompt to the large language Model results in a much smaller prompt uh much more token save but also uh very ACC accurate answers because it has the chunks it has the information that it needs to answer the user's question so if we go ahead and select the knowledgebase option we'll see there's two fields that we can potentially enter first one is question that's the query that we're going to send to the knowledge base so that it retrieves the appropriate information from the knowledge base now for our uses here in this one what we want to send is a variable not just we don't just want to free type a question we actually want to say what the user asked so that variable is kept in voice F by default under the variable last utterance you can access the list of variables by doing the curly brackets opening and then it will give you all the list of the the variables that are available last utterance is going to be the one that the users query their most recent input into the chat system that's what it's saved under and since this one there's only one message that could have possibly sent to trigger this it's going to be the last one so that's why we choose last utterance for the question there instructions for the response we're just going to leave blank we don't need any special formatting right now for our knowledge based retrieval we just need it we just need the information basically so we can leave that one blank you'll also see the option here to override prompt settings which you can click on if you toggle that on it'll give you various options you can change the model if you'd like to chat GPT you can adjust the temperature up or down we'll keep that low the tokens that it retrieves from the model depending on your use case usually around 200 is probably good you don't want to be it to be too wild on the temperature if you're unsure of what all that means go ahead and watch my previous video on the large language model uh prompting fundamentals so you can learn about that the system message you can or we will leave blank at the moment but you can enter a system message if You' like and then you can also preview something by entering a value for like a sample user question we can't do anything because we haven't input a knowledge base yet we can't preview that but that's how you would do that if you wanted to so the next thing we'll go over is how to actually construct this knowledge base for your business you probably have things available depending on your situation already some information about the business you can also link specific URLs or web pages or even a s map and it will just read the information directly from the site in this case I created a specific document for the knowledge based had basically like a list of FAQs and for to to build it out I used chat GPT here's the prompt I gave it and it gave me its sample response and then I just slowly built out using a similar prompt as this the different sections of the knowledge base and you can use this not only to build out your knowledge base but also for constructing uh your intents you constructing questions that users might ask you know just say hey chap GPT can you give me a list of sample questions that visitors might ask this agent that I'm building uh my business is this and it'll give you a big long list of potential questions you can modify those you can tell it to be more creative you can use it for all sorts of gener generation like this obviously you'll want to go through its result and modify it but this is how you get the base this is how you get the format the base information and then you can go in and adjust it based on your particular business now once you actually have the knowledge base built out and that can take some time obviously but once you have it built out and it's it's pretty accurate in order to load it into your model so that it can actually be used by the agent you'll want to go back to the dashboard for your agent this screen right here you have a subl list of different options over here uh the one we'll want to go to is knowledge right now there's no data sources so we'll go ahead and click add a data source I'm going to upload a file you can do various things and we're going to upload our V volti knowledge base import it and it's loaded pretty easy now to get back to our workflow we'll go ahead and click workflows then you double click this line that's the easiest way it'll take you right back in there and now we have our knowledge base all loaded in and now when we start the chat we'll get this message we'll say what types of services do you offer it's not text support or billing so it should route to the knowledge base and you get the answer because it knows it's not Tex support it's not building so it sends that query to the knowledge base instead the knowledge base is able to find that information or excuse me the model is able to find that information in the knowledge base and so we get an answer here now just to show you what happens if you type something completely random nothing happens here because that question is not found in the knowledge base and also Al we haven't established a path for not found when it's not found in the knowledge place there's nothing there so it just ends the chat doesn't answer the user's question because it can't and there's no additional path for what to do when that happens so it just ends and by the way since we have them up here this information over here is your token usage it shows you how many tokens were sent to the model and then the adjusted amount of tokens that were used against your voice flow account quota based on the model that you're using because chat chat gbt 3.5 is a cheaper model it's only 6 of the amount of the standard amount of tokens that it used one thing I wanted to mention real quick I'm back in the knowledge based screen you might have seen it on your own but I wanted to go over it real quick if you click the settings button here this is going to open up the settings for the knowledge base specifically you can change the model you can change the temperature of the max tokens you can change the chunk limit usually like two to three three is going to be best for simple uh FAQ type type situations where your knowledge base should be able to retrieve most of the information I like to change this system message here because frankly it doesn't make sense to me says your responses should be fewer than a couple of sentences which is sort of uh paradoxical I like to change it to just your responses should be a couple of sentences something like that you can adjust it for your use case obviously but but I like to modify that so what if our model can't answer our question from the knowledge base like when we ask it a completely random question or if a user just ask it a question that's relevant but just for whatever reason not included in our knowledge base that's where this not found path comes in you can just create this you can do whatever you want we're just going to create a simple message saying hey sorry we couldn't find the message but go ahead and email me directly for an answer to the question I'd be happy to help you out so I'm going to put that in real quick you can do whatever you want obviously in your chat Bots but that's how you would handle something like that so now no matter what whether we were able to answer the user's question or not we're going to create a new message here and just say ask if there's anything else we can help the user with today and you can see underneath there's this variance line this gives you the option to add variance manually so it's not saying the same thing every time or you can do it again with AI similar to before when we created utterances with generative AI this is a similar thing and then you can choose which things you want to accept we'll just do these three so now it'll randomly pick one when we get to this step we're going to go ahead and connect both when we're able to answer the user's question with the knowledge base and also when we are not we're going to want to go up to this block as well so both want are going to ask is there anything else we can help with today and then the user's going to say something so we need to listen for that answer this time we'll go ahead and put some buttons in there again with buttons the user can still just type free flow this just gives them some additional options we'll put a button in there for yes we'll put add a button and we'll put a button in there for no you can also attach a tense to intense to the button so instead of clicking yes they actually say yes that's where you can attach the yes intent you can do that for no as well or any other intent or button combination you want to have now let's say we test this and we get the message here and it gives us the buttons that we just put in but let's see now user puts in one of the intents from this previous step like text support or billing you can see even though that it recognized tech support was the intent of the user there was no path there was no intent listed here for Tex support to maybe go down this and Trigger this tech support process so that's where before when I talked about these triggers these intent triggers if we get out of this test and we go to add trigger uh this if you set up a trigger like this it will look listen I should say for Tex support intent throughout the entire chat and if it had been up when we went through this test it would have detected that the user wanted text support and it would have routed it here so that's a a situation where you might want to use those triggers if you have multiple places where the user can input information and you want to listen for intense in all of those places just something to keep in mind so going back to these buttons what do we do if a user says or clicks on yes we can route that to wherever we want we're going to Route it back to just right back to what can I help you with today we'll start that process again and what about no if they say no they don't need anything else well in that case we will want to Simply end the chat you can do that under the action section here and just click and that will just end the chat but what if somebody just ask another question like what is your pricing or do you have any deals going on well in that case we would want to Route it back to the knowledge base and so to do that we'll go ahead under this button section what if there's no match that's where we click this little path here and then we click this little plus button next to path and now we'll get this pop out for when there's no match to either of these intents so what do we want to do we want to send it back to this new block 4 and here real quick I'll show you you can actually title these blocks and then for the path you can simply go to that particular block you draw the arrow you'll go under actions there's going to be an option to go to block you might have seen that and then you simply select the block users's question now when they ask another question it will simply route to this block we'll send it back to the knowledge base it'll either answer it if it can or it'll say not found sorry I couldn't find the answer so let's say we wanted to add some functionality where if a user ask three questions in a row and they get their answers we want to do a sort of lead capture step where we ask them if they're interested in scheduling a consultation how would we do that well first we would go in and we would delete this direct connection from the answer of the user's last utterance to the is there anything else I can help with question we'll delete that connection just by clicking on it and click delete and we'll want to utilize some of these logic steps over here to set up some variables and also trigger a certain condition if a variable is set so let's say we wanted to do it where if they ask three questions in a row we want to trigger the lead capture step we'll go ahead and use this set variable block under logic and then we'll go to variables to set we'll want to select the variable from this list now we actually don't have the variable that we want yet we'll want to create a variable which you can do by clicking here variable name here we'll just do number of questions you can enter a description if you like and a default value the default value is zero so we'll just keep it at that and click create variable and then we'll click this to actually set it to something so every time this block is triggered what we wanted to set it to is the number of questions plus one so it'll basically keep a counter are going and we can keep track of the number of questions that way so each time this block is triggered it's going to go from 0 to 1 1 to two 2 to three and you'll be able to see that when you test which we'll do in a minute that the variable is actually changing as we go through the flow so we'll connect it up here and now what happens when it actually hits the criteria that we set what happens when we get to number of questions equals three we'll go back to logic we'll use this if condition you click that with we can drag it right under there and then we'll put in we can enter a label if we want check number of cues and then we can actually add the condition now obviously if you're familiar with programming this will be pretty straightforward if not I think you can figure it out we are checking if a particular variable number of questions is in our case we're doing three that's the criteria if number of questions is three you can add additional conditions if you want to do Andor statements but that's the basic one that we're doing now what do we want to have happen after that we're going to send it to the lead capture step which we'll put up here we'll ask them if they're interested in scheduling a free consultation with one of our Representatives then we can add some buttons for yes for no you get the idea you can initiate your lead capture here uh you can definitely do it where you ask use the agent to get the information you know their name their email their phone number whatever it is uh and then populate that in a database on the back end or send an email with that information uh I've done a where it just links to the form on my website whatever you want to do but we won't get all the way into that we'll just leave it at this but that's how you would do that part of the step and after you set up the if condition to check if the number of questions is three if it's not that's where you'll use this no math or no match again it's basically the else statement in that case we will want to just route straight to is there anything else I can help you with today so now we've got that set up we direct them to the form on our website if not we just route them back to the beginning of the conversation here and keep in mind you can use something like this for really anything it could be you know signing up for your newsletter joining the email list get a free guide lead magnets that sort of thing anything you want to do you can pretty much configure it in voice flow using something similar to this so let's test our agent from the beginning we'll click Start here we'll ask first what service we have and you can see here the number of questions variable was updated from 0 to one that's how it shows that in the debug mode when you're doing your test we'll click yes for can I assist next we'll ask about pricing you can see the knowledge base will give us information about pricing and then it we adjust the variable count from one question to two and then we'll try one more time here we'll ask about any discounts we're offering and you can see it answers the question about discounts and special offers and then it recognizes that the number of questions is now three this if statement triggers and it takes us to this block so everything seems to be working just about normally now the last thing I wanted to show you guys was how to integrate with make.com and actually create some outside external action based on what happens here within the agent so that's what we're going to do right now what I want to do is if let's say a user does ask a question that's relevant to the business but it's not in our knowledge base and we're unable to answer I actually want to be notified about that notified of the question so that I can potentially add it to the knowledge base so that people who ask it in the future will have that information available so here's what we're going to do we are going to tab over to make.com and if you're not familiar with make it is essentially a platform for helping to integrate a bunch of different automations with different Services similar to zapier we're going to create a new scenario and we're going to set up something called a web hook a custom web hook a web Hook is essentially something that listens for some incoming information so that it can then push it onto wherever it needs to go we'll click on add a web hook the web hook name we can name it voice flow tutorial web hook and hit save and now you'll see this little icon running that it is listening for the data and and it'll determine the data structure from the incoming data so what we want to do is copy the address of this web hook to the clipboard so it's now copied we'll navigate back over to voice flow and here we want to set up an API step in voice flow so we're going to go ahead and delete this connection here after we say we're unable to find an answer to the question and we're going to go over to the dev menu and API and we'll click and drag that over here and if you're not familiar with all this the the HTTP methods get post and all that uh don't worry about it we'll go into it in more detail in a future video but basically when you're posting information you are submitting information to whever it's going if you're getting information you're trying to retrieve some information so since we're submitting the question the user's question we want to have that sent out we are going to change this request to a post and we simply paste in the web hook URL that we had before now you can set up a bunch of different information the headers the parameters the body depending on what your use case needs in our case we don't need any of that there's no authorization required or anything we just need a body and it's going to ask for a key and a value in this form data format here you can also choose these other formats we're just going to do the key value format we'll call this users question and the value we're going to set to be the last last utterance variable the last thing that the user said that resulted in the model not being able to create a valid answer so we've got the URL in there we've got the data in there in the body we're going to go ahead and hit send request before I do that I want to show you it's still listening for the request we'll send the request we'll enter in a value we'll say the user entered asked about if there was a deadline any deadline for our services let's just say that we'll click generate and we get the response this 200 response means it was an okay response everything should have gone well we'll navigate back over to make.com and you can see here now that the format has been successfully determined by that sample request that we sent so we'll click okay now that we've got that web hook set up we'll want to add a module to it create a connection we're going to scroll down we can you you have a ton of different options here we are going to use the email function and we will send an email and so when you get into this email section this is where you can connect the email address that you want to send it uh from I've just got my business address connected in there you can do that in the connection then you're going to set where you want to send it to we can just send it to the same email address you can see here that it recognizes the web hook has some incoming information the user's question that is the data that came in so you could set that if necessary as the email address we're going to go down here to the subject field we'll put in unknown user question and for the content here we'll want to go ahead and put in that user's question this is where the web hook comes in and that format the key and value you can simply select the user question and drag it over here and put it into the content and that's about it for our purposes here we'll go ahead and click okay and now we can click on run once to get the web hook set up to listen just for this one time we'll navigate back into voice flow we can actually resend the request because it's that question was fine we can simply resend the same request we'll click resend we'll navigate back into make and you can see we've got the green check marks which indicate it did receive something and it did go through to the email successfully so now we want to check that email address and see if it got the unknown question in the inbox so we'll navigate to my business email now and once we've refreshed we see that we have the users's unknown question we'll click it and all we have is just the question that I said is there any deadline to use your services which is exactly what we put in all the way over on The Voice Flow side now we are getting it on the back end to my own business email address so let me know someone had an unknown question maybe I want to add this to the knowledge base maybe I don't obviously you can customize this in a ton of different ways but this would be the general idea of how you can connect things in voice voice flow to things on the back end like a database or a Google spreadsheet or an Excel file or a ton of other things just whatever you need done this would be a simple integration you could do to perform it now we'll want to actually connect these blocks here and then in the case of success or failure if it failed for whatever reason it doesn't really matter we'll connect both of those up with this new block six just asking if there's anything else and that sort of completes the loop they can ask another question they can end the conversation but that completes everything so the cycle should work now and that's just about it for our super basic agent that we have built here you can do other things to customize it like changing the color of the different blocks depending on what you need it for obviously you can switch these around and make it look much more organized much more pretty much more streamlined that sort of thing but yeah this is just a base to get you the lay of the land of voice flows or how everything interacts how it flows together so you can understand what you can start building but by all means iterate on this improve on it expand I will copy this template if you want it into a VF file and put it in uh the description a link to it and you can download that and then upload this if you didn't want to start from scratch and once you're done the only thing left to do is to get this agent onto your website so to do that you'll simply navigate back to the main menu of the agent here you get down to integration here on the left hand side navigate to the web chat section and then you copy this snippet of code and you paste it on your website you can also customize how the agent's going to show up on your website you know where what it looks like that sort of thing you can do that here but that's it it's pretty simple I've done it a few times now and I haven't had any problems with it and my friends thank you so much for watching that is going to be it for today's tutorial I hope you got some
