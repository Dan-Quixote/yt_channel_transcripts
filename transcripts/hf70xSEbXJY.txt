how's it going everybody rob here just wanted to do a quick demo of the image labeling app that I whipped up really fast for my Tinder machine learning project just to give you a quick demonstration of how it works and how you might be able to use it for your own projects so real quick the reason for this app is because I downloaded a huge data set off of kaggle it was over 1.2 million images from Instagram but the images were all just random images they weren't all relevant to the purposes that I needed them for which would be pictures that you might find on a girl's dating profile so I wanted a quick way to sort through all the images choose which ones were relevant and then label them also all the while saving them in a folder as well as a CSV file and this app almost works like a Tinder in a way which is kind of interesting because I'm using it to build a Tinder machine learning program or model I'll show you how it works once you booted it up you'll get this real simple simple interface you'll select the image folder by clicking load image folder you'll select the folder with your images in it and then you'll get this interface here it's got the image and it's got a few options down below now most of the images in the data set like I mentioned are not relevant for my interest and in that case like this one uh you could just click next image it'll just basically skip the image go right over move to the next one you do this a few times until you get to an image that you think is relevant now this image definitely one you could find on a girl's dating profile so one that would be relevant to include in my data set for demo purposes let's just say I find these girls attractive I click yes to add them to the data set what that does it does two things we'll come to this folder here this is you specified in the code which I will link in the description below first it copies that image to the images folder you can see we have it here and it will also update the labels CSV file with both the image name and the label that I assigned to it so let's get out of this we will not save we'll go back we'll demonstrate one more image another picture you could uh expect to find on a girl's dating profile let's just say for demo purposes uh I think no no offense to any of those ladies but we're just showing the demo here we'll go back to image that image has been saved labels file name label and so you can see you can just go through this really quick now because it's more efficient and constantly moving your mouse back and forth to select the images I've binded some keys on the keyboard uh I think it's one is yes zero is no and just to load the next image you just hit the right d so you can real quick just go through tons of these obviously you would want to uh pay close attention to the images but let's say yeah so this is a image well let's just say this is an image a girl would put on her dating profile I'm not sure if she would uh we'll go ahead and hit we won't click it we'll hit one for yes you can see I didn't click on it there I just hit the one key but there it is it's saved to our images folder and this is what you do you can just go through these one by one now I do want to say I'm pretty new to the uh to machine learning I'm definitely a novice all I've taken is an a fairly introductory course and now I'm working on my own project to sort of hone my skills so I have no idea if this is uh really a good way to do it um I'm sure there are much more sophisticated professional and clean ways to do it but but for my purposes what I need for this Tinder project I thought it was a reasonably efficient way to do things so I just wanted to share it obviously you can modify it for your own purposes and if you have any questions be sure and let me know everybody take care
