what's going on everybody my name is Rob WN and I help businesses unlock the power of AI with voice agents and today I'm going to show you something really cool it's going to be how you can run custom code in your make.com automations using a service called AWS Lambda now make.com is great for automations it's uh an excellent low and no code platform but with that setup the low and no code does come some limitations sometimes you need something a little bit more robust a little bit more involved some custom code so that's where AWS Lambda can come in and you can run these custom code functions in your make.com automations and have everything fully integrated so that's going to show you how to do today going to show you how you can set up the function in AWS Lambda how you can integrate it into your make.com flows and how you can test it out to make sure everything was working correctly so let's dive in so here we are in make.com and we're just going to use a super simple basic trigger for this one just going to set up some simple variables and what we'll do is we'll go ahead and add a Lambda function we're going to invoke a function but before we do that let's actually create our Lambda function so we're going to hop over here to AWS Lambda uh if you don't have a AWS account it's very easy to set one up you can go ahead and do that first but once you're logged in you'll want to navigate to the Lambda service and you'll come to this the screen where you have a list of all your functions and you'll simply create a new function give it a name select your runtime for this one we'll just use Python and we will create the function by clicking the orange button down here give it a second and that'll bring us to the function editor and if we scroll down a little bit we'll come to the actual code editor portion where we can Implement our code and set up our logic so if you're not familiar with Lambda each Lambda function has two parameters an event parameter and a context parameter the context parameter is sort of metadata for the function you can disregard that in most use cases the event is passed as a python dictionary it's a Json object and then pars into a python dictionary so that's how you access it so real quick I'll just write the logic for our particular code which is going to be simply adding two numbers together which we will pass from make.com as arguments into the Lambda function when we invoke it with that module so we'll just write this we'll just write standard python code and I'm getting these variable names from the make.com trigger module where I set them up I'll show you that in a second add them together and then we'll simply return the result now once you've written your logic you'll deploy your function by clicking the deploy and a good idea also is to test your function before passing any variables in make so you can do that by clicking test you can create a new test event for something simple like this we can simply keep this uh hello world format and then just rename the variable names with what we need our variables are going to be num one and num two and they are integers so we'll get rid of those strings and then you can click invoke to actually test the function and we can see the response is what we'd expect so our Lambda function is working correctly when we have a properly formatted payload so let's navigate back into make.com and we'll go ahead and add this Lambda module you'll set up your Lambda connection if you haven't already done so you'll click this drop down and find your function here's our demo fun that's the one we want invocation type is request response and then for the body you'll want to put this in Json format so we'll just type this out manually you will want to use double quotes here so it's proper Json and then we'll load in the variables that we set up in this basic trigger just like that close the brackets click okay and everything should be working correctly we'll go ahead and run this once oh I want to show you this basic trigger we just set up a couple of variables you can do this manually in here uh to get the ball rolling on this scenario and then we'll click uh run once and we've got got the output from our Lambda function it correctly added those two together and then if we wanted to we could go on and add more modules and use these Lambda outputs as variables in our next module and so on and it's as easy as that you have just learned how to run code in this case python iny make.com scenarios which can open up so many possibilities for custom Automation and make your flows much more robust and much more scalable and if you found this video helpful please give it a like if you have any thoughts or questions or comments please leave those in the comments below if you're interested in more advanced usages of AD Lambda go ahead and subscribe and follow because I will be posting more advanced use cases for this time type of Automation in the future other than that thank you for watching and have a great rest of your day
