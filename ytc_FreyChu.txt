will AI be able to replace sales development Representatives that's the question that has been bringing in my head ever since I recently started a SDR role this video is for people who are current sdrs such as myself or for people who are looking at Tech sales as a potential career choice and are curious if AI is going to be able to replace it in the future these are your bdrs and your sdrs bdr is business development representative and SDR is the sales development representative before this I actually worked with one of the pioneers of AI called copy.ai so let's actually start by talking about what an SDR does on a day-to-day basis for the most part an SDR will handle any inbound leads or we have to go out and do outbound and prospecting to hunt down those leads ourselves and from there we typically have to make sure they're not a current customer especially if you get a job at a larger organization your database can contain hundreds of thousands of leads so you want to make sure that you're not going to call someone who's already an existing customer then you actually have to call them right you actually have to pick up the phone you're going to have to uncover if the stage of their business is a current Fit for Your solution your software or whatever solution that you're offering then from the call you're probably asking a bunch of qualifying questions making sure that they are the perfect ICP or ideal customer profile typically this can be how much revenue a business makes how many full-time employees a business has and what the timeline is all this stuff that you need to uncover to make sure you're like okay yeah this person has a good chance of buying and then from here you gotta close the meeting or you gotta nurture them or you're going to close the sale but typically sdrs just book the meeting so that the account Executives can handle it right if you're already an SDR you already know this I mean I I'm preaching to the choir along with these responsibilities sdrs typically use a few different softwares just to do their job correctly this can include a CRM like Salesforce a dialer which allows you to record and listen to your dials perhaps a marketing tool that helps you find the email address or phone number of the lead that you're trying to reach LinkedIn sales now I mean come on and then some kind of email software something like a Microsoft Outreach where you can add them to a email sequence which will drip as time goes on in my short time being in SDR I've noticed that there's two main skills that separate the top performers and the not so great performers the first skill being the knowledge of the product when a customer is looking for a product answer the questions in a way that's valuable to them rather than just trying to shove a product down their throat especially if it's a software you want to know if it has certain products or features certain Integrations if it works within a certain vertical or industry and of course the actual sales process to lay out the right expectations to the prospect there's just a lot of information that we have to know as sdrs the second skill is the ability to uncover if the person is the right ICP I mentioned ICP is the ideal customer profile maybe you're speaking to what you think is like the perfect prospect it's been 20 minutes you guys are just vibing you guys are talking and at the very end you share some pricing details and they're completely priced out that was just a waste of 20 minutes because you probably could have done a more efficient job on covering that ICP earlier on in that conversation and they disqualify people as quickly as they qualify people who are a good fit so that's the second skill that I've noticed that top performers are really good at so now that we have the crash course of what an SDR does the tools that an SDR uses on a daily basis and the two skills that top performing sdrs actually have we can actually talk about AI what is the big deal with AI in a sales role like software sales and is it actually able to automate some parts of our job in order to answer this I want to catch you up with a pretty huge announcement that Chad gbt made which is that they're going to be introducing plugins first let's head to the plugin store to install the necessary plugins let's ask chatgpt for a restaurant recommendation on Saturday a recipe for Sunday the total calorie count and to order the ingredients on instacart first it's using OpenTable to find me a great restaurant for Saturday if you go on chat gpt's website you'll see the instacart plugin and the Expedia plugin basically AI is going to get a lot more integrated in the softwares and the tech stack that we're currently using as sdrs this is happening right now it's kind of like when Apple started the App Store and allowed people who built these apps to sell them to us one of these Integrations is zapier if you're not familiar with zapier it basically allows a bunch of different softwares to communicate with one another zapier connects the apps you use every day and automatically moves information between them doing that work in the background that's just one way zapier can do work for you so you can have your Salesforce be connected to your Google Sheets to be connected to your convertkit or MailChimp or whatever email provider you use and you can basically automate tasks that would take a lot longer if you were to do it manually the fact that AI is going to have Integrations is really big news that will make our jobs easier and in the future may pose a threat to a lot of jobs maybe even including ours but nothing I've noticed is so threatening in the sales world that it's actually threatening our jobs and one of the big reasons for that is our job is very very human and that's why my theory is that sales will not really be easily replaced by AI so will AI allow us to automate a lot of tasks using their third-party plugins yeah definitely that is 100 coming I wouldn't be surprised if Salesforce HubSpot Microsoft Outreach all the big names are eventually going to make their way into the AI space at the end of the day the reason why I don't think AI is really threatening to sdrs is that this job requires so much human touch and as humans we're able to do a lot of things that AI won't be able to do at least for some time and the first one is tone right it's like body language but for voice you know we can make the difference between someone who's saying hey I'm pretty down to purchase this I think it sounds interesting versus hey I'm pretty down to purchase this this sounds really interesting totally different tonalities that have completely different intents and I'm not sure if AI is going to be able to tell the difference between those two for a really long time the second thing humans do better than AI is persuasiveness and urgency a human will be able to say hey what's planned on your roadmap how how much of a priority is this do you want to work around the holidays or do you want to implement during the holidays I don't think an AI bot will be able to kind of understand the full scope of the person's next 12 months and what lies on their roadmap ahead the third superhuman element is the delivery and the ability to be concise now either Ai and voice technology is going to get really really Advanced to the point where a conversation can flow just like we're flowing right now or AI is going to have to do our jobs all through text based selling imagine asking all the questions we ask over the phone and providing all the information Shin that a prospect needs but it's just a large wall of text even if it is an interactive chat bot of sorts it's so much more tedious to have to read every single answer especially if an answer is not really clear-cut I don't see that experience for the customer being one that they will want I'm sure there are customers out there that pay so much money in software subscriptions every single year they would rather pay a premium to deal with a human than any kind of advanced AI so those are a few different very very real advantages that us as humans have over AI as sdrs and Tech salesmen so for that reason I think Tech sales is going to continue to be something that is pretty well protected by AI due to the huge human involvement that is involved with each interaction if we're able to do our jobs but in half the time I can see that being threatening to a larger sales department of 100 people who may only need 60 people to do the job of 100 people once all the AI stuff gets sorted out but again there are a lot of what-ifs behind that door if you're just graduating from college or you are pivoting your career and thinking about going to Tech sales I still think that it is a job where you can earn a lot of money if you stick with it that offers some level of work-life balance because if you hit your quota you're basically good and it does have a higher guard to the threats of AI if you enjoyed this video I talk about business personal development and AI so if you want to see more of that content then please subscribe down below

so today we're talking about six of the best practices of effective facebook ad copywriting if you stick around to the end i'm gonna share one of my new favorite tools that i just discovered it's guaranteed to improve your copywriting in literally less than 15 minutes and the way it does that it's an ai artificial intelligence and it helps you produce not only just facebook ad copy but startup ideas blog ideas and all sorts of other different useful copies that can essentially help you grow your business but first let's dive into these six tips to help boost your facebook ad copywriting the first tip is to know what are the questions your customers have when they first visit your page my first two years of business was a lot of talking to people at trade shows so over the course of talking to thousands of people i would notice that they would ask the same questions over and over and over again and what this helped me do was when i actually started running facebook ads and building my online presence i knew exactly what they were going to ask before they purchased so i can include these things on my landing page or in my advertisement and address any concerns beforehand so they don't have any mental roadblocks when they're deciding whether to click on the advertisement or not there's a couple tools that can definitely help you identify what are the faqs the frequently asked questions that are kind of based around your product or your service and one of these tools is answerthepublic.com where you can type in a keyword or a competitor that has a large online presence and you can kind of get an idea of what are the common questions they're asking on google and other different search engines tip number two is a hook in my opinion a great hook is kind of the perfect combination of maybe four to six words that address what you're selling and who you're selling it to the process of me creating a hook usually starts with me compiling a list of 30 or 40 different keywords that are really relevant to my product then the next step is pretty much just to play with different combinations of these words take out some words that are not really relevant or not as punchy impactful and then i'll just spend literally 30 minutes to an hour playing with different combinations of words until one of them just kind of comes out of the tongue super smooth you know what i'm saying like you'll know when you hit a good hook because you're like damn that is just super punchy it just goes through all the noise and it just hits you right where you want to it's those combination of words that not only capture what you're selling but captures the unique point and who it is designed for all right the third tip is to speak in problems now what do i mean by talking in problems well let me give you a quick example so i sell ethical footwear that's the industry i'm in now instead of writing a facebook ad copy where i say ethical footwear that's made comfortable and made with durable materials something like that right it's just an example instead of saying that i might want to say something along the lines of most ethical shoes are expensive but don't use a durable material to back it up our shoes are guaranteed not to crack and peel or wear out for over 10 plus years something along the lines of that right i don't want to get too salesy up in here i think that's a good example to kind of speak in problems rather than just showcase the features of your product or service and expect people to be interested people want to know that you share their problems and you've gone out and created a solution the fourth tip is to talk to the individual not the masses a real simple way that you can do this is to include the word your in the first sentence of your ad copy so another example of this with the footwear you can say something along the lines of your walking experience just got better now compare that to a ad copy that says our shoes are guaranteed to improve the walking experience it's like what are you talking about and who are you even talking to like that's just super vague right it's just a personal rule of mine i just try to use the word you or your so that i can address the person straight on talk to them in the way they want to be spoken to and use the word your and you to make it more personalized like you're talking to an individual the fifth tip is don't go for the sale immediately i know that we're all here trying to optimize for conversions and i highly stand behind that you should always be optimizing for conversions rather than view content ads to cart initiate checkouts and whatever else there might be most people who fail at facebook ads and this was me included in the very beginning they just try to go for the sale immediately right off the bat rather than educating people providing value you know out here in venice beach you know there's people who always will come up to you asking you to buy their cd and they're just trying to launch their music career and every time i go to venice i see these people trying to promote their cds and i'm just like dude i don't even know what your music sounds like i don't know if i even like your style of music i don't even know you as an artist there's just so many questions i have before i want to make your purchase and support you that i'm not interested don't go for the sale immediately try to talk to people about maybe your founder story educate them about your come up the way your product was manufactured maybe there's an ethical essence that might really appeal to a younger audience that really cares about the environment there's so many different ways that you can get the conversation going just don't ruin it by making yourself sound super salesy when they don't even know anything about you yet alright the sixth and last tip is to use social proof one of the things that i do with my facebook ad copy is sometimes i just open up with a quote from a customer sometimes customers have this unique ability to capture the benefits the essence the wonderful part of our products that we just can't produce in our own words it also really helps humanize your brand in a way because one it shows that people are buying your product two if it's a good testimonial and it's very casual it reads well and it doesn't sound fake then it's going to actually do a pretty good job of capturing people's attention you know if you've been ridden about by forbes entrepreneur medium use that as social proof and that will really give some authority to people who are just newly introduced to your brand all right now that you made it this far i want to share with you a amazing tool that i just found it's a relatively new tool it's called copy.ai and it's exactly what it sounds like at the end of that extension it's an ai meaning artificial intelligence if you've been following artificial intelligence it is very very advanced at this point the reason why i want to share with you is because i think it has a huge huge opportunity to boost a lot of people's facebook ads all you have to do is figure out what kind of copy that you want to create whether it's facebook ad copy maybe a blog idea even a business idea it has a pain point identifier where you just type in your product and it spits out different pain points that you can use to write better ad copy uh or maybe even website copy to really resonate with those readers at the moment i'm making this video it's currently 35 dollars a month but it is originally 99 a month they do have a seven day trial i believe but if you're interested in using this tool go ahead and click on the link down in the description below and you can access this tool today make sure that you like this video if you enjoy this content it helps this content get out there to people who need it and that's really all i can ask for at the end of the day um with that guys i hope you guys have a beautiful holiday season and i will see you guys in the next video peace

one of my biggest goals for 2021 is to become more financially literate and actually one of the reasons i started this whole youtube thing in the first place was because i was curious about how am i gonna pay rent how am i gonna pay for food i'm sick and can't afford to go to the doctor i was curious about if i could still build a living online in 2020 by making videos so i thought i would actually make a video on my first actual monetization of this channel and i think right now i have 85 subscribers and i'm currently making a passive income amount of 28 and that's just from one single video so the way that i did it was i just used the affiliate marketing route and i think that most people use more like amazon links i think that's the most common affiliate route that works but amazon's also notoriously known for having really low interest rates or not interest rates but uh commissions what used to be you know 10 might be two percent now so when i was making these youtube videos i was asking myself how could i talk about something i'm interested in that will also be valuable and could make me some potential money off of that that video and because i i do e-commerce and i have an online footwear brand where i do private labeling and all that i decided to talk about some of my favorite shopify plugins and one of them actually ended up getting several thousand views ever since that was at like 2 500 views people started to sign up using this link that i offered in the description and it's a product reviews plugin that pretty much lets store owners do product reviews it's kind of unique and it has some cool little features that make it really special and i showed off how much money it's made me for my store which was pretty a pretty good amount and i think that was enough for people to install that plug-in so if someone pays 20 a month then i'll get four dollars in commission every single month for that sign up i want to share this one because i want to be more transparent with my financial journey i'm testing a lot of different ways to grow my business but also grow a personal brand that i could use to grow my business and help other people and i really love the angle of helping small businesses because as a small business owner myself there was no guide to getting from zero dollars in sales to 1 000 in sales to 5 000 and five thousand to ten thousand and so on so forth because a lot of the business content out there i feel like is how do you make seven figures a month i don't know how to make one million dollars plus a month because i haven't even made a thousand dollars a month and those are the kind of individuals i'm currently targeting because i have the i guess i have the experience to share some knowledgeable tips that i've learned along the way and here's the thing man like i'm not financially in a drought i'm really blessed to be at home with my parents this is my home and i'm very very fortunate to be able to reduce a lot of my expenses by living at home i'm in california and the rent here is absolutely insane i don't know how anyone my age is going to afford to buy housing in the future but that's another discussion for a long time in my life i feel like i was spoiled i didn't really have any rush or desire to improve my financial situation because i felt like i didn't need to and that i was young but now that i'm 26 i'm thinking well i have certain goals i want to create a certain business or a lifestyle that i envisioned for myself in the future and this has really steered me in the direction of just becoming more educated around financial stuff and even though this is more of a marketing channel i do want to share more of my personal goals and things that i want to achieve i think a lot of people in my situation are trying to accomplish this i think a lot of people are changing their careers more and more people are looking for ways to work at home because it's kind of the direction the world is going in especially after the pandemic so yeah i just thought i would share that and how i monetized my youtube channel at i think around 60 subscribers and it's not much but it's proof that you can make some money when you're building something before you hit that monetization rate if you enjoy any kind of small business content if you are a small business owner i'd love to talk about things that could help you and things that you might be struggling with if you can't get past a certain monthly earnings like a thousand dollars a month five thousand dollars a month it's usually something that you can fix so i'd love to talk about that and i'd love to kind of dissect that uh together if you're watching this i appreciate your attention and making it this far it means a lot i'll catch you guys later and see you guys in the next video peace

receiving an advertisement only hours after tweeting that you were looking for advertisements and i wish i got to see that face all right guys today we are making an advertisement for a company that i use it's called copy.ai i was scrolling twitter when i saw the co-founder tweet we're looking for someone to help us with high quality video ads for copy.ai if you know someone or a creativity agency that's easy to work with tag them below or dm me now this tweet was sent out at 7 47 p.m on december 10th it was tweeted right around three hours ago now sometimes i get this really weird feeling that overcomes me i just feel like creating stuff the first thing that i thought when i read that tweet was i can do that so i thought about the company which is copy.ai it's a startup right now no one really knows them at least not on a large scale but they're growing very quickly personally i love the tool you know i see that it has a lot more potential and i think that this is one of those tools that are really going to help people build whatever they want my plan is to create an ad so real quick the rundown right now it's like 10 30 at night dude i'm gonna film this anyways the idea okay the idea that i have in my head is that i want to kind of approach this with kind of like a sadness in the beginning this relatability because 2020 has been one hell of a year especially for businesses whether you're a super small one-person team or you're a large company ultimately this software does target businesses so it's more b2b and it would make more sense to gear the messaging towards a one-person business a small business or medium business i think the use case of this software is really good for either someone who can't afford a digital marketer copywriter marketer in general or they're very busy because they're wearing a bunch of different hats and they can't spend all day thinking about blog ideas growth ideas and all that kind of stuff anyone from a solopreneur to a small business with under five people under 10 people maybe so anyways the idea starts with you see a post where it says record deaths in a day i'm sitting in a dark room where darkness swallows me up and the only thing that illuminates my face is the light of my computer screen it's a voice over where i tell this narrative of my own business getting hit really bad from all the things that have happened in 2020. it's kind of just like hitting them with relatability first no one likes to hear that businesses are are suffering even if you are anti-capitalism you're just like you know if you see a mom-and-pop shop or a small business owner or a young person trying to make it it's pretty sad to see that they've been hit so hard so that's kind of the angle i'm approaching them with but there's one thing that there's one thing that i can fall back on for inspiration and that's a simple tool called copy.ai i kind of want to make it more moody than like oh happy you know because it makes sense uh in terms of the messaging who i'm messaging too it's got relatability it talks about the product the only thing that it's missing is that i have a rule of thumb where i try to showcase the product i'm selling and who i'm selling to within the first three seconds and i think i'm hitting the nail on the who i'm selling to but i'm afraid that people with short attention spans don't really get to the product and its features but anyways we'll see so that's the plan i'm gonna try to film this i'm gonna try to edit it hopefully by tomorrow and then we'll just see what their response is with copy.ai turn anything into a great idea so right now we are clocking in we're calling it at 11 59 so it's just i'm gonna edit this real quick and in the next clip i'm gonna show you the finished video that i made in just about an hour in my room so check this out 2020 hit a lot of us small business owners really bad every single night i ask myself what can i do what can i do to survive until we can all get through this together sometimes i feel like growing a business in this time is an uphill battle but there's one thing that keeps my ideas alive it's called copy.ai all you have to do is choose one of the many services that it offers give it a short description of your product and you'll get a ton of quality ideas with copy.ai turn anything into a great idea all right it's officially the next day i made the ad i sent the ad to the founder of copy.ai his name is paul and we got a response so here's the actual conversation here i don't know if it's going to be sharp or not i said saw your tweet earlier made this spontaneously tonight what do you think and that was at 1 59 a.m and that specific time i'm in california so he says yo that's awesome can you shoot me an email with that video file so i can show my team and that was at 4 34 am so we woke up just a couple hours later and i thought that was going to be the end of the interaction and like i said i'm a noob at twitter uh so i didn't really know that i should or like that i could i didn't think about tweeting it that i experimented with this first of all i'm just most curious about what his reaction was i wish i could get his reaction receiving an advertisement only hours after tweeting that you were looking for advertisements and i wish i got to see that face i was going about the day not really thinking about it but at 2 p.m i was like let me just tweet what i did so i started this tweet thread which is pretty common in twitter i kind of just explained my thought process with creating the commercial so after i posted my tweet thread i did get a retweet from paul just a couple hours later he says i sent out a tweet last night asking about video production firms frey literally went and filmed his own ad and sent it to me at 3 59 a.m i went from having a total of i think 19 twitter followers and i have 29 now which is pretty cool all right i just woke up and it's saturday december 12th it's now the day after which means it's been two days since i sent that video right now the tweets had 21 likes and i have 36 followers which is pretty freaking cool man i'm super stoked about that what's more interesting is what allowed this to happen how this happened in the first place it's not so much who it happened to you and what the actual growth numbers are the ability to exceed someone's expectations based on how quickly you can react someone left a comment mentioning action bias and how if you just took action then you can essentially get more attention onto yourself onto your brand and it's almost hard to ignore because you're just so you just don't expect it at all i think the part that makes it so interesting is that you can offer value to virtually anyone and it's yet another example of proof that the internet is an incredible place if you use it right pretty confident to call this entire experience a success with that guys i have to ask if you enjoyed this please give me a thumbs up and consider subscribing if you like content around business tech film catch you guys in the next video see ya

hey guys this is Frey and today I want to make a quick video on the best ways to use Opus clip so if you're not familiar Opus clip takes long form videos and chops it up into smaller short form videos which could be really good for just repurposing redistributing content but there are some things that you should know about it to get the best results because we're not yet at the point where AI is going to come to life and massage your shoulders for you right I'm waiting for that AI robot to come and do the work for me but it's just not quite there I'll also be talking about one thing that I do to make sure these clips turn out way better and have a much better hook because we all know that's super important when it comes to short form content so basically what I use it for right now is I'll have interviews on Zoom with people that I want to chop up into smaller forms of content and I'll say if you just want to take a really simple long form video like a zoom call or an interview that you just want to turn into small Clips this is a really good tool for that what's cool is you can actually choose a few different subtitle looks you get you know a few different options and they're really reminiscent of like the Alex heroi videos lastly you can actually edit the amount of time that your clip will be so you can say out of an hour video I want all of them to be 30 seconds long or 30 to 90 seconds long a minute long now one of the things Opus doesn't do as well is actually come up with a really good hook now when you import a video into Opus you get all of these grades right so you'll say oh this video clip has an a for a hook it has a B for flow um and it kind of gives you just a grade of the clip but I don't really feel like I can trust it just based on what I've seen and what I've shared to my friends one approach that I found to actually make Opus work a lot better is if you actually manually clip your long form video before you insert it into Opus I know it's like why am I using Opus if it's not going to save me a lot of time well actually I still think that it can save you a lot of time it's just so much more worth spending an hour or however long and removing all the fluff that you know for sure you don't want in the video when you just plug and play with Opus a lot of the filler ends up taking up a lot of time and in my opinion those those pieces of content are not going to perform as good so let me show you a quick experiment I took my hourlong interview with this person and I put it into Opus and here's what I got there was a specific moment in this interview I definitely wanted to clip the Highlight I was looking for describes how she went viral on social media but unfortunately I wasn't able to find it this is the closest thing that I found ever since then I've just been writing it like every week or twice a week for premium subscribers wow if it were me I would scroll right past that on Tik Tok it wouldn't even be a question so what I did was I took that original clip of an hour I took out all the filler this is the result of that most of the growth doesn't come from the consistency it com comes from that one post that does very well and it takes off and all the followers come from that one post but you can't really get to that one post until you post a lot okay so that was just the 11 seconds that I wanted and was really bummed when I couldn't find it in that first iteration of Clips just another reminder that Opus is best when you actually do a little bit of the work before you plug and get these clips they do have their own internal editor but I personally just not really big fan it's really simplistic though like you can choose where you want to start certain sentences and where it wants to end but I just am not a big fan obviously editing comes down to personal preference I personally would rather put it into premere Pro or Final Cut there are ways to actually incorporate b-roll from stock photos or AI images the stock image and the Emojis they just don't really add that much I almost think they're more distracting for my purpose than it is um just to to keep it simple real quick I thought this was hilarious but when I tested out the generate B rolles with stock images it basically did this check this out I'm sharing that story yeah um I actually posted about my systems multiple times what is that this guy looks so concerned took off but I knew there was something there because everybody I to like what is that an exit sign but I can also see this working well if you have a different kind of use right let's say that you are a real estate videographer and you basically want to make like a highlight reel for for them and it's kind of like their advertisement I can see that being way more effective the stock footage the AI content would actually Aid in helping the actual storytelling with my purpose long form interviews I just don't really see it as being super useful my recommendation is that if you're on the fence about Opus just know that it is really built for people who have really simplistic needs no b-roll no extra content Graphics photos you just want it clipped up subtitled putting it out that is what Opus is super good at hope you guys enjoy this content and you keep on putting yourself out there subscribe you know if you enjoy this content and hope to see you guys in the next video see you

so i found this mom who's making over 60 000 a month and is on track to make over 70 000 this month in september of 2022. in this video i want to talk about how i got this website on my radar a little bit about the website the stats traffic and a little bit of nerdy seo stuff and lastly what makes her business brilliant so let's get into it so the website i'm looking at today is called happy toddler playtime now obviously 60 000 a month is absolutely ridiculous for a blog to be making every single month but you know this is proof that this can be done and it can be done by going into a profitable niche now i've been obsessed with this website called hrefs if you're into seo and digital marketing you've definitely heard of this tool it's one of the go tool tools for keyword research before we go to the website i want to talk about some of the stats so here we can see they're getting roughly 131 000 people coming to their website every single month we can see here that they probably started this website roughly around may 2017. actually the first few years they really didn't earn a lot of traffic and a lot of money and they made their first dollar right around september 17th if you think about it that's four months just to make their first dollar by the time the pandemicates in 2020 they're starting to scratch the thousand dollar a month mark here we just have an insane spike where in march of 2021 i don't know what happened they earned the equivalent of 97 000 a month in traffic value now it was only that one spike so maybe something happened around then that really spiked that the traffic but even then they're steadily growing you know obviously when it grows it really really goes the questions i have when i see this is how long did it take them to make make their website this successful and whether or not the traffic is coming from anywhere else besides their seo so this is the website it's called happy toddler playtime play creatively with your little one so here we can see the person behind it her name is mandissa and she's a mother of three sharing easy and creative play based learning activities and crafts for kids zero to eight years old so she's very obviously targeting the niche of toddlers and of course the parents right there's no way that a three-year-old is scrolling on a website so here we can see one of the ways they're monetizing this website they are running some ads probably through google adsense or some kind of program where they just put ads all over their website now keep in mind that 70 000 a month figure is purely off of the organic traffic value this doesn't include the money they're making from their shop where they're selling play-doh kits construction site play-doh kit cupcake factory play-doh kit exciting sensory bins for kids we don't even know how much they're making they're probably making a lot more considering the amount of traffic that's coming to the website for me it makes sense that the niche is really profitable because parents are willing to spend anything to make their kids happy or maybe occupy them so that they can free up their time or just so their toddler can learn you know this is one of those shops where i'm like i would never guess that this person is making this much money off of a single website relatively speaking 2017 is not that long i mean that's a five-year business just from the ads they're pulling in almost a million dollars every single year in revenue looking at their website they're probably over that one million dollar revenue a year mark because they have their entire shop it also includes sponsored posts giveaways advertising product reviews instagram takeovers so they're making a boatload of money another thing that was pretty shocking to see on this website was um their social media so on instagram they're absolutely killing it with 282 000 followers but check it out pinterest is another huge huge huge thing for them but right now their pinterest gets over 10 million monthly views that's just insane like i just don't i just i would never have guessed that let's see if we can play one so this is just like a okay ah oh wow oh that's actually pretty cool that's actually pretty amazing that is really creative that is crazy videos on pinterest i never thought that that would be such a a big traffic driver but it makes a lot of sense parents who have really young kids are probably finding different ways to keep them occupied and this is like the perfect avenue for them they're obviously doing a great job creating these videos that are showing different ways to entertain their toddlers and then they're driving that traffic to their website where they then sell the slime kit and then they probably sell the knowledge on how to create that maybe link it to amazon link it to different websites and then earning an affiliate commission through that insanely smart and a very simple funnel another thing about this is that they're killing it with the the seo too they're position one for memorial day crafts that is searched 17 000 times every single month i mean kids activities kids activities is searched 75 000 times a month and they are position two on that so that is insane it's also a keyword difficulty of 75. that is insane that they're able to rank second for that they're probably getting an absolute bowl out of traffic just for that she's straight up monetizing her kids which is so smart because it's not like they're oh they're obviously having fun that's what you call getting a great return on your investment early all right that sounds kind of bad here we can see an email capture lead which means she's probably collecting these emails and then again promoting their shop items whatever products that they're selling um which is so smart so they're probably building up their own email list and doing a bunch of sales just through email marketing if you met someone on the street and they were like oh you know i'm a website blogger you'd probably think oh maybe you're making a few thousand dollars a month not this person this person's probably in beverly hills kicking it chilling maybe not beverly hills they just keep growing and growing like they are hitting their all-time high month this month of over 70 000 a month they were writing for a few months without any results that just shows that it takes a lot of time for these content businesses to pick up and to start ranking on google and to start getting traffic so there's a few reasons why i think this niche is so good number one is that parents are always looking to spend on their kids when it comes to entertainment or learning there's just an endless amount of things that you can get for your kids two is that kids get bored easily so they're probably playing with this slime or playing with this toy car but they're probably going to get tired of it bored of it which means as the parent you're left with the challenge of finding something else the third reason i really like this is because this is like giving supplements to your dogs or your supplements to your horse if you give a toy or a book to your one-year-old they're probably not going to go up to you and say hey mom hey dad i don't want to read this book they're probably just going to play with the book or look at the pictures and then move on to the next toy just like horse supplements or dog supplements the dogs aren't going to be able to tell you hey this vitamin c is really doing it for me it's just it's just not going to happen and it's just like really really smart but at the same time not really deceptive and it does solve a real world problem the fourth thing that's a genius is that she has an email marketing play in here if she does lose traffic through google or pinterest or instagram she's still able to collect emails and then sell her products through her email list which i'm sure is tens of thousands of moms and dads who are looking for exactly this kind of stuff now if you enjoyed this and want to see more of this content let me know down below in the comments because i love looking up websites like this i would love to share more stories about individuals who are just making a killing out there hope you guys enjoyed and i will catch you guys in the next video see ya

hey guys it's frey and today we're talking about email marketing and which software you should choose according to your business i've tested out every single one of these softwares that i'm going to talk about in this video throughout the last three years what'll really help you narrow down your options is what kind of content are you going to make and how are you going to get to know your customer better the first thing that i ask myself before i even look for an email marketing software is like what am i going to be posting what am i going to be writing about what kind of content am i sharing if you have a physical product and you're selling something very visual something like art or banners or clothing and you want to really sell the product and tell the story in a visual way you might be looking for the best graphic templates or you might be looking for ways to really make that visual shine the second thing that i need to know is which software is going to allow me to understand my customers better in your store you might have several different products that speak to one kind of customer and not all of the customers that are gonna shop at your store are the same they're obviously gonna like different things and if you have a wide array of products they're probably gonna end up liking one specific product more than another one so which software is really gonna allow me to organize that and which software doesn't do that so well so first let's talk about mailchimp this is the first software i used so mailchimp is painted as a very user-friendly email marketing software it's very much focused around graphics and visual templates it's very like drag and droppies kind of like squarespace in terms of being tech savvy you don't have to be very tech savvy to operate and know your way around mailchimp mailchimp is really good for if you're selling illustrations or graphics or maybe jewelry something that you know customers want to see visually and not so much in writing but because it is so graphic design heavy and there's so many different templates and there's a lot of uploading photos and videos into your email i found that it can get glitchy sometimes and i remember having to deal with some of the glitches in writing copy and uploading visual designs also with mailchimp i believe it is free up until you have 2500 contacts or something so if you're just getting started mailchimp is definitely a pretty good option but in the long run you may have to transfer to another email marketing software if you're looking for a better deal next clavio is the second software that i tried out so before i dive in i just want to give a quick disclaimer and say that i've spent the least amount of time working with clavio because for my personal preference i didn't like the user interface and that kind of drove me away and i felt that it was a little bit more difficult to use just right off the bat and i was quickly turned off by it but i do think it is a great software for a lot of reasons and a lot of companies do use clavio so i don't want to deter anyone away from that so what's different about clavio is that they offer sms service where you can essentially create like a texting relationship with your subscribers i know it's getting really popular right now but i personally don't prefer it i think that email is still super strong and very relevant and so i don't want to talk about something i don't know but clavio does offer that while the two other softwares i'm going to talk about do not offer that in my experience the software worked fine in that i was able to send out the email and i was able to attach links do photos kind of do the basic stuff but for some reason i have to say that clavio's user interface really drove me away even though it was integrated with shopify i felt like at its price point it wasn't something that i wanted to deal with now clavio is the highest priced software just in terms of you know total subscribers i found that clavio was more expensive earlier on for probably the first five or ten thousand subscribers but once you build your email list up to you know fifty thousand a hundred thousand i think that clavio is a great option so now let's dive into our last contender which is convertkit now this is the third software that i use and i currently use it for both of my shopify stores so the reason why i decided to go with convertkit and change all of my email marketing functions to this service was because i wanted to focus more on the writing as my email marketing strategy developed and matured what i found was the most helpful wasn't so much those really graphic-y picture-heavy emails that just said sales sale sale 20 off really what i wanted to do through email was establish a long-term relationship one of the features that convertkit has that isn't available in mailchimp and clavio is what i call bucketing but i think they call it segmentation a quick example of this is i sell shoes right it'll essentially create buckets of different customers who are interested in like only boots or only sandals or only heels and that way i can create content that's more specifically geared towards those kind of customers another second reason is convertkit is not very fancy it's super simple and super clean interface i remember signing up for the software and there's a lot of helpful tutorials but even when i skipped all of them i knew how to navigate the back end of the email marketing i don't want to have to learn a software i want to get to writing or creating an email that's going to help me grow my business and get to know my customers better now as a footwear company it's still important for me to include graphics and stuff so i like that convertkit still allows me to do that in a really clean way i can add buttons links photos videos whatever i need to do it's just a simple clean template so that i can really focus on what's important which is writing an authentic letter to my subscribers and updating them with what's going on with the brand price wise it is more expensive than mailchimp i believe but for the ease of use and the segmentation feature i'm totally down to pay a little bit more that's just me personally so if you want to use convertkit and give it a try and check out what i'm talking about then go ahead and click the download button below i believe they have a trial a free trial as well and you can go ahead and take advantage of that and lastly the most important thing is that if this has helped you in any way i would really appreciate it if you just click that thumbs up button or hit the subscribe button if you like talking business with that guys thanks so much for watching and i'll catch you in the next video see ya

hello everybody my name is frey and welcome to my channel today i'm talking about canva and five different side hustles that you can do to make a side income the side hustle game is popping right now let's just say how it is the world right now is going crazy now is the time that people are experimenting with a lot of career changes side hustles and just different things right we're all just kind of on this path where we're trying new things and learning i know a lot of you have experience with canva because their free version is an incredible tool so let's dive right into it so the first idea is a photo background remover now there's a cool effect when you buy canva where you can take a photo and remove the background so that it's just the object or the subject and the rest of the back is white now why would this even be something that people need a lot of these business owners are not necessarily you know tech savvy or they don't necessarily have the time to go and figure out in photoshop or illustrator how to quickly remove a background this creates so much tedious work that a lot of the times they just go to websites like fiverr and just outsource it completely when i was starting with my business i literally had 600 photos that needed to be removed and i paid some guy like 300 i think on fiverr which is around 50 cents per photo and i thought it was totally worth it it saved me hours and hours and hours and i was happy to pay that because of the time it saved so in terms of actually finding people that hire you and use this service i would try fiverr that's definitely a great place to start maybe upwork maybe even cold emailing businesses try everything right try everything under the sun i want to give a quick disclaimer and say that while canva has an incredible free tool a lot of these ideas will require you to upgrade to the pro version to access a lot of the effects and a lot of the illustrations the emoticons that will give you a huge edge in your design you can use my link down below to go ahead and check that out so the second idea is creating thumbnails for youtube channels i think the key to this one is not so much your tools with canva even though that's extremely important it's more so your knowledge about thumbnails and observing studying different people who use really really good thumbnails people like logan paul like mr beast casey neistat maybe i love this idea because there's so many people who are making youtube videos and are just doing it themselves so when it comes to actually creating a thumbnail it almost ends up being this chore that you have to do at the end that you don't want to pay attention to because you did all this front end work to create and produce your video and edit it so if you can understand the science behind thumbnails and how they work you could approach and message these small to medium sized youtubers and show them a portfolio maybe even recreate a thumbnail for one of their videos and say hey i recreated this thumbnail i think it would look great and catch people's attention more so than the one you have currently you know you can start to talk about pricing then so the third idea is podcast art podcast art is also kind of similar to the youtube thumbnail thing right the main difference with podcast art is that it's not something that needs to be recreated every single week or something that has to change all the time like a youtube video canva has a ton of different little emoticons i think you call them but essentially they're little illustrations that you can like plop onto your design you can use this to bring different styles and different graphics to really bring alive a piece of podcast art you can recreate your art in different forms to fit facebook banners or instagram profile pictures you can do all that kind of stuff and charge them based on the package so that they can get more value and more assets overall number four creating digital flyers for businesses now this is one thing that i've done myself a lot for my business just designing flyers that i'm going to print the thing with this is you want to target different industries where people are constantly printing think about wedding invitations a lot of other businesses include flyers and print them out to promote them in other businesses to include them with every single purchase in these kind of cases it leaves a great opportunity for you to show off your design skills and to design something that is beautiful yet delivers the purpose that the person wants maybe you can even extend your service and approach a business and say hey i want to create and design your flyers but i also want to go drop it off at the local store or drop it off everywhere so that different people can start to pick them up and then you can promote your business kind of in a gorilla marketing kind of way now the fifth idea is logo making so if there's any designers who are watching this you guys probably just cringed that i just recommended canva to create these logos and to that i respond with a quick disclaimer i don't think you should be creating these super high end logos these two thousand dollar logos with canva just because the tools are not all there compared to something like adobe illustrator or photoshop there's just too many things that are missing from the tool itself to create something that premium but if you're just talking about creating a logo for someone on fiverr who just needs a quick logo for maybe an idea that they're experimenting with maybe a 10 15 logo then you can really start to get good at that especially if you're pretty crafty with canva you can really create something pretty beautiful i think so those are five different ideas that you can use to create a side hustle on canva i think that if you spent an hour a day just learning different designs or getting used to the tool and then building a platform or using a platform like fiverr to get some business it could be really good real quickly guys if you can give this video a thumbs up it would mean a lot to me it would also help this content to reach other people who might need it hopefully you have a wonderful week

hey guys it's frey here and welcome to a garage sale saturday where i take you on a journey with me to flip some items for that sweet sweet cash baby and if you're new here then if you're new my goal for 2021 is to make an extra 1 000 on the side just from garage sales wow so without further ado let's go on this journey together and see if we can find anything of value let's do it it is 10 45 a.m which is kind of late for a garage sale this is all the way in fall brooks california which is probably an hour and 10 minutes to 15 minutes away this might be a huge bust or it might be an actual gain i found this one garage sale that has star wars comics from the 90s and beanie babies now one of the pictures showed one of the beanie babies and i looked it up on ebay and just one of those sold for 150 just the other day so i was like damn this is super far but i might just have to go for it this is the first day that they have the garage sale so i would say that my chances of getting this are somewhat high i'm going to stay optimistic but i feel like a crazy person dude because i could be driving all this time for nothing it's a beautiful day out so might as well just enjoy the drive and then get back and see what we get [Music] the good thing is that we didn't leave empty-handed i got a ton of vintage beanie babies and i have probably over 30 of them here this is one that i was looking at because it sold for a 150 price tag but we'll see if i can get that i paid 75 she wanted 185 for the entire thing and i got it down to 75. i don't know if it was really worth it because it's gonna take some time to actually list these but we're gonna see so there's that cute little water 75 is more than i thought i would get from it i was trying to get like 50 bucks for the whole thing but you know it's okay because we drove all the way here and we didn't come empty-handed we are back in the studio you got a little glimpse of it in the car but now it's actually time to look through all these beanie babies and see how much value is actually in this box i think i slightly overpaid so i got 36 vintage beanie babies which are a little bit bigger and then i got 21 of these smaller beanie babies in total we have 57 total beanie babies that we got for 75 i think i really could have gotten it for even less and i feel that my negotiation skills are they're in the works let's just put it this way the whole time she was kind of revealing how much of a bother it was just to have these in her home and it was it was just like very obvious that she was done with them so might as well get cracking and i'll get back to you once i know more information so i just spent a solid hour going through this the beanie babies that we hear are worth thousands of dollars are definitely not in this collection before i actually mention the total price estimate of what i think i can sell all these beanie babies for i actually want to talk about some things that i learned while researching this stuff the truth is that 95 probably even more of beanie babies are not worth more than five or ten dollars i thought that a lot of these would be worth more because they were from the 90s but after looking up the market price on ebay i don't think any of these are really worth all that much right now i'm hovering right around like the three dollar to 20 range now one of the reasons why it's so hard to price these is because i have some beanie babies that look exactly the same as the one that i have that sell for thousands of dollars on ebay and the next listing which looks identical will sell for three dollars i don't know enough about beanie babies to know why it's worth so much from what i gathered it actually comes down to a few factors things like the kind of pellets that you use in the beanie baby in the 90s there are beanie babies that were using pvc pellets and pe pellets and millions of the beanie babies that used pe pellets were created which means that they're not as valuable but if you have a beanie baby with pvc pellets and it says it on the tush tag as they call it because the tag goes on their tush then that's worth more because it indicates that it was one of the smaller batch that was made it's a whole world and i'm i'm definitely no expert in the beanie baby game i mean i just bought these because i heard that they were very collectible and people still collect them to this day so i kind of took a gamble took a risk and it looks like we probably just maybe barely profited the total estimated amount for the beanie babies that i bought i would say is right around 300 to 320 the way that i see it is that i can either sell each individually and reach that 300 ish mark or i can just try to sell the entire lot for like 150 or 200 and that would probably save me way more time so as someone who is way more interested in time i think i'm leaning towards just selling the entire lot i learned a very valuable lesson with garage saling the first lesson is that if you have a lot of inventory just like with any business it's really hard to get rid of at least that's something that i foresee if i were to list each of these individually of course it leads to more profit but all that time that you take is probably not going to be worth it if you can just go out and sell it as an entire collection the second thing i learned is that negotiating in the moment is a real skill that takes practice and it takes guts i definitely knew that i could have gotten this for way cheaper probably could have shaved off an additional 30 dollars but i didn't stand my ground to the extent that i wanted to but you know that's just part of the learning and that's just part of the hustle i definitely learned more about plush toys than i thought i would today so if you learned something or if you got something out of this maybe even some entertainment please hit that like button and consider subscribing to my channel if

hey guys my name is frey and today i am gonna review a udemy course that i'm gonna take i am gonna learn effective time management get 10x more done in less time i'm gonna review it based on the value i get according to the price i get and the entertainment and just the overall like would i recommend this to someone who is also struggling with this and i figure that since a lot of people are just in their homes now or working from home a lot of people's schedules got messed up and everyone's just adjusting to what will probably be the next year or maybe even longer of just like you know social distancing and whatnot let's go into the computer and i'm going to show you exactly what course i'm taking and then um we'll we'll see from there all right guys we are on the udemy website and today i kind of just i was browsing these different courses and there's like 150 000 courses i'm pretty sure uh when it comes to udemy it was kind of hard to choose which one i wanted uh but this is a good one for me because i feel like i've always been bad at time management ever since i was in high school i would always procrastinate and every assignment i would wait until the last minute just just to finish and i've seen some of those habits translate to my workflow and in my first business that i launched a lot of the things i feel like could have been more optimized i guess the workflow could be optimized let's just go through the course a little bit um first off 9.99 is a killer price and you really can't you can't complain with that and i like that it's only one hour so we'll see what i can learn in one hour and i'll tell you guys if it's worth it basically the thing i'm most interested in is not really the reviews or anything i just want to learn about the actual guy or girl who is hosting this class his name is william you pina and damn he has 250 000 students and 17k reviews so he's he's killing it on this on this uh course right here oh william is also a certified success coach what startup investor and has an mba in international business guys i've never been i've never been a student to a success coach i always feel like it i don't know there's something weird about it but then again i don't want to hate on something i haven't tried so this is a good experience so we're going to go ahead and buy this course right now and then take the course and then i will get back to you on if i think it's worth it so i'll see you guys in a bit one hour later okay guys we just finished the course and to prove it to you i even got this certificate of completion and it says that i completed this course over here so i'm going to be scoring this course in five different categories one is the price one is the value and information that i received third was engagement was it fun to learn about the topic was i engaged fourth will be was it easy to understand and the fifth area is what i'm going to call irlp which is in real life practicality are the things that i learned actually useful and practical to apply into my own life and use on a daily basis to deliver more happiness wealth whatever it is right starting with the price right off the bat i'm gonna have to give it a 10 out of 10 on the price because 9.99 i mean i could go and get a chipotle burrito yeah which is pretty valuable to me even if this was terrible i mean 10 is not a huge loss in case it was bad which it wasn't but um yeah so 10 out of 10 with the price next is the value and information that i received in terms of all the strategies and all the things that he he discusses the ultimate goal for for him is just to maximize profit or things that lead you to profit another thing is that he broke down a lot of these familiar concepts that i've heard of for example the pareto's law the 80 20 principle in a different way that i didn't hear it before and even though i was familiar with that topic he was able to present it in a way that was pretty refreshing and it kind of opened my eyes to um you know how i spend my time which is exactly what what it should be doing now in terms of the value and the information i'm going to score this in 8 out of 10 and really i feel like the only place it could have improved was to broaden it a little bit more to people who are not in business and not entrepreneurs if someone wanted to improve time management and wasn't starting a business then perhaps their definition of value would be different and that's the only reason why i would knock off two points so let's move on to the third one which is engagement i have to say i'm going to give this guy a 6 out of 10 and it's not because he was the most boring guy in the world but he just wasn't the most exciting person in the world in terms of the actual visual it was just a powerpoint slide and i actually didn't see him talking in front of a camera or anything and i think that would have really improved the engagement the reason why i want to still give it a six is because throughout the course he had a few different exercises that would have you riding that would have you making lists and really looking into your own life figuring out ways to improve it i just found myself kind of pacing around my room during some of the slides and uh i don't know i guess powerpoint slides kind of brings me back to elementary school when you know that's all you would see so 6 out of 10 but hey you know what that's fine if the information is good right the fourth one is was it easy to understand and this one i'm going to give a 10 out of 10 everything was very easy to understand and there weren't very many like complex topics or words being used so everything was pretty sweet and the final category is in real life practicality is this something that i can actually use to apply to my life to that i'm gonna have to say it it's a nine out of ten overall it was um it was very applicable you know all the things it was it was simplistic and it it forced you to look at yourself in a way where you can make uh changes immediately he kind of helps you break down every single task in your day and identify which of these tasks are bringing the most value and that way he's able to advise which ones you should cut out completely and then he goes even more in depth with when you can do it how you could do it and set up an environment to succeed so if you add it all up and you divide it by five then that means overall i would give this course an 8.6 out of 10. what i recommend it i would say if you have a business and you you're just starting out then it's kind of hard to recommend it because there's just simply so many things to do and it could make you feel like what you know as someone who has operated a business for three years some of the things that he talks about are things that i took probably two and a half years to learn i would say if you are you know kind of in the midst of growing your business and you're like okay well some things are working and some things are not working then yeah i would recommend this course because it kind of helps you look at your own schedule and sometimes we don't even take 30 minutes to an hour to look at our own schedule our own routine with that guys um go check it out if you want hopefully you guys enjoyed this video and don't forget to hit that subscribe button or that like button if you want me to

when you're starting from zero how do you actually build a personal brand I spoke to someone who went viral three times in 14 days and gained over 12,000 email subscribers in that time and it was all organic so she shares all of it here in this interview with that said here's Jennifer aka the vegan technomad and her Amazing Story I basically wanted to reach out because I joined your master class it was 5:00 a.m. where I was at so after you were finished I was like I need to go to bed go to bed it way too late I appreciate you waking up at that time for that cuz it would have been 5:00 a.m. for me too I'm usually in the west coast but I was traveling then so it was 8:00 a.m. but it was still so early I'm like used to waking up 1: p.m. are you still working a full-time job right now yeah um I work for an education startup very nice I always like to start with how did you actually decide on a newsletter or how did that world of newsletters come into your life yeah it was kind of unintentional cuz I started like I always heard you have to collect emails because otherwise you're going to if you lose your account that's it and then you're like you have to rely on the algorithm and everything so I always had that newsletter Link in my bio and it was like not active at all I didn't post anything it just said coming soon it didn't even have any pictures or anything it just said coming soon you put your email that's it and then when I went viral like a lot of the emails started pouring in and I was like oh now I have to write one so I don't disappoint these people so ever since then I've just been writing it like every week or twice a week for premium subscribers okay yeah I want to unpack that you covered it in your master class but can you cover a little bit about posting on social media and how you went viral if you don't mind sharing that story yeah um I actually posted about my systems multiple times it's just it never took took off but I knew there was something there cuz everybody I told to everybody I talked to about this system they're like oh this is so amazing this is so unique so I'm like there's something here um but I posted on Tik Tok not Instagram so I was like to myself I'm going to take this seriously in January so then I started setting things up and like scheduling all my Tik Tok posts for Instagram and then that was one of the posts that I had already posted on Tik Tok that I just scheduled on Instagram and I think the timing was very good cuz it was in December and that's when everybody's like trying to figure out the New Year's goals and like setting up healthier habits and resolutions and stuff so I think that's why I went viral and then I saw that and I was like oh it looks like people like this productivity content let me pull up some of the other notion and other stuff that I do so I just made videos and then like two more videos also went pretty viral so it was just like the growth from that but I was looking into the analytics today and I actually didn't some of the videos that got a lot of views and comments didn't get me a lot of followers it was the work documentation one that got me more followers and I'm assuming subscribers so I'm going to probably focus more on work and work productivity now which is like I was going to focus on food and travel but that content is too hard for me to make anyway I guess when you pivot you got to Pivot when you see you got to go for it um I didn't know you wanted to start as a food and travel um Creator but that is it's just too hard to make like I have a lot of vegan food photos and like travel photos because I was like you know I can expense all my purchases now all the plane tickets and stuff but um it's just really hard to edit those videos together and I never did it so it's easier to film myself in my laptop screen basically showing your productivity uh templates to friends and they were they were digging it they were like obviously finding some value how long have you been creating these notion templates like I guess how long did it take you to get the skill to like create that was it just solving a problem for yourself how did you go from creating it to actually making it a product people would be willing to buy yeah I think a personal brand is really big um because I have to sell stuff for my work as well and it's like people don't trust you unless they know you so the difference between selling for work and for my own stuff was like super Stark and I was shocked by how much like being a creator there like how it's different but for the notion templates I basically just made it myself like I learned how to do everything and I had some creative ideas and I was like why not just share it with people because I think it'll help them so all my templates were actually free for like two months um and I like extended the free period because I was like you know might as well help more people and then when I made it paid I didn't expect to make any money from it but it turns out people are willing to pay so I was shocked by you know I had these document mentation about like Financial Planning and it was yeah it was a lot more than I expected and then um for getting people to buy it was just like a storefront um I get some people saying that like they can't afford which I feel bad but um if feel like not fair to the people who've already paid if I just like start giving them out for free plus I think that when you get stuff for free you just never use it um whereas if you pay for something you kind of value it more so I do have some I usually redirect those people to some of the free templates and not the paid ones and then of course like my email news letter is free um and then some people told me they were saving up which I was like oh that's so nice um that's the best compliment yeah and I think it's because they trusted me and it was like more relatable cuz when I'm trying to sell for work stuff it's like oh there's a company it's like if he like you don't know the person would you have um not posted your content for free if you were to do it over again or would you just keep it the same because it built trust I think I would still keep it free but maybe not for that long cuz I kept it free for like two months um having it be free really helped with the growth I think but um I know I could have made a lot more if I'm paid but I was kind of struggling for a while because I was like I feel bad charging people for things I'd rather charge companies so like sponsors and stuff but you know I'm gonna have multiple revenue streams anyway and I feel like people don't value this stuff unless I charge a little bit for it yeah I actually did my whole Revenue breakdown today for my premium newsetter Subs if you're interested in the finances $111 a month is that is that right for the premium yeah that is I can screen share my finances but I assume you're GNA ask more Finance related questions later we don't have to get into it now yeah I was going to ask about it because I did see your B2B take most of your Revenue in January right so I was going to ask um I didn't even know you were selling B2B so what what are you selling B2B yeah it's um mainly sponsorship stuff and then some agency work but I can share my screen so can you see that Yep this is the email that I'm going to send out tomorrow um but there's like a whole financial planning template I did and I was like this is what I'm going to do for February but um I ended up like this is the expectation I expected to make more more from B2B than b2c but I actually it ended up being more 50/50 but I do cash basis accounting I think it's called and not AO so like my I actually made I think like over $1,000 like almost $2,000 from selling temp this month but half of that money is not going to hit my bank account until March so I count that as March Revenue not February but if I counted like all the sales made in February it would be closer to 5050 but since you know I use a different system I'm like checking the bank account when the money actually hits the bank account um it's more like 38% and 61% so this was like my forecast and then this was like what actually happened and I was like calculating my time spent and then like where the revenue streams what the revenue streams were and then I outlined it all here um and then my plan for March to basically double that and then like kind of reverse engineering and like going week by week what I need to get done and all of that wow a builder in public that's insane you you said basically December was a huge month you know I saw that you went from 3 to 12,000 subscribers like once you grew to 12,000 was it like okay time to start approaching sponsors or using sponsorships as a main form of income or was there a way to incorporate sponsorships before you had all those email subscribers I well I went viral which helped a lot and when I started sharing everything um everything was inbound like I never really had to reach out to too many sponsors unless it was like a company I really liked and a product I used then I would reach out to them um and then they would usually say yes but the first sponsor I got I think they found me from Twitter or something because I was just sharing everything that I was doing and they paid me like 300 bucks and I only had I think I had around 10K subscribers or maybe less than that um and back then like the 300 bucks was so much to me cuz it was like my first um money that I made and I didn't even do anything it was just like I hadn't even sent out too many emails yet and then they just paid me and I think I undercharged I think like I undercharged a lot this month but well you learn um but yeah it was mainly them reaching out to me um I gave a lot of discounts because I was like I'd rather build relationships and like get testimonials so I can pitch to Future sponsors but I think I did that too much um because some sponsors just said yes right away and I was like oh I should have charged a lot more um oh well now I know that's how everyone learns right you undercharge yourself um beginning what does uh what does a sponsor get when they when they pay you and or how much are you charging now okay so it's very different um I usually get a lot of sponsors from beehive which is the platform that I use and they just um send me like people who want to put an ad in my newsletter I don't have to do anything but they do it on a cost per click basis so like if a few hundred people click on the sponsor link then they would pay me like $2 or $3 per click $3 is a lot actually so it's usually like $2 um so I remember one of the emails I sent everybody was really engaged with it and I got a few hundred clicks and I think times two so like it was like $600 for that one email and I was so shocked so and then like they they kept wanting to sponsor me after but I think people were just clicking on those to support me and not as they liked the sponsor because it was some weird business tool that like I still don't really understand what it does um and what I found interesting was that people were willing to pay more and I got more sponsors for my newsletter than for Instagram and I noticed that the results for Instagram aren't always good even though I have the DM automation set up um so that the engagement boosts the post and it sends them the direct link um sometimes the stagram stuff just doesn't do well or like people don't see it but if it's in their email inbox they get it for sure so I think a lot of people are more willing to pay for that last month or like in February I think I made a mistake cuz somebody offered me like $1,000 for three ad placements in my newsletter for three weeks so that's all of March's ad slots are basically gone because it's like three weeks in March right so I was like dang now you know $1,000 which is like 300 and something per email but like I can get more than that get more um so the $ thousand just like shook me cuz when you have a big number like that I'm like oh my God yes but um when I do the math and like divide it up I'm like oh this is not that great that's awesome I mean that's a good problem to have you you've done such a good job like being transparent and building loyalty it's it's really refreshing it's really cool thanks but I feel like sometimes being too transparent is not good because and all my um stuff is just there and anybody can use it against me but hopefully not what's the uh what are the growth strategies like right now I know obviously you're big on Twitter but if you were to kind of lay it out for someone um you know what what was your growth strategy in the beginning and how does it compare to to now yeah I think it's just being consistent and taking action um for like I specialize in Instagram videos because I had to do that for work as well and I was just spamming vide videos even if they weren't really good as long as I just kept posting um people saw them so through that and Lead maintenance helped a lot so in the video I would have like this insane hook and then be like hey if you want to have this template you know you have to like comment something and I DM the link directly they don't have to sign up for my email list through it but I think people appreciate that they don't have to do that and they get the link directly and then I promote myself like everywhere and then and that way I get higher quality subscrib so that's one way that I used to grow my personal stuff for my work stuff is just like constantly making the videos and promoting everywhere and we also grow using Facebook ads but then I test the videos on Tik Tok and then take the best one for Facebook ads um so those are the main ways I grow Twitter I feel like I don't really grow that much from it it's more so I look back and see what I've done and then like when I post all my learnings it's very like stream of Consciousness and I go back back at the end of the week and I read through it and I consolidate it for my premium newsletter subscribers so it just helps me keep things organized most of my money I think comes from just like you know my own networks through sponsors or like Instagram Ros and I have a whole bunch of tips for Instagram Ros but to be honest it's going to depend a lot because I have an agency client where I'm doing Ros for him and like for some reason they're getting zero views on Tik Tok and I'm not sure why so I have to look more into that um and I think it's because we're not posting enough only like 30 videos per month which I undercharged myself again but it's okay so you're are you doing like freelance stuff outside of newsletter stuff yeah but I don't I I wanted to try it because I'm like oh wow it's like $1,000 from one person or one company but um it was a lot of work for just that um I'd rather work on my own stuff yeah no totally and it seems like it's paying off when you say like not posting enough like if you had to give a number which I I'm sure is hard but what would would be like the rule of thumb be for it's gonna sound insane but for my work account on Tik Tok the way we grew was I was posting like five times a day um but I batch filmed everything and it was like some of them were like seven second videos it was just filming my screen being like hey you know this exists so it didn't take too much time and then I just had so many videos I'm like okay this is going to become outdated if I schedule it for like one month later so I needed to post it immediately and it ended up being like three to five times a day um almost every day except maybe not on weekends um so it was a lot and that's how we had a big spike so we grew from like zero followers to like 20K or something on Tik Tok and then we grew even more after I started getting better and posting like at least once a day but most of the growth doesn't come from the consistency it comes from that one post that does very well and it takes off and all the followers come from that one post but you can't really get to that one post until you post a lot and your videos get better and you kind of understand what people like to see but I think that only works well on Tik Tok um because you know everything is just so much more shortlived there yeah so for a work account I would just post everything on Tik Tok and then see what does well and then use that to post everywhere else so like Instagram and ads and stuff I love that you're like fully leveraging your job to actually like get better at your business which is not what people do they all oftentimes don't have a connection like that actually it's so funny because I think one year ago I also write the newsletter for my work but um my company didn't really see the value in it so they're like stop spending time on this so I stopped but um one year ago beehive inter interviewed me and they're like about this work newsletter and they wanted to learn how I like Leverage my work stuff for the newsletter and then like one year later I have my own newsletter now so like they recognized me and they were like hey like I knew that you were gonna do great things or whatever I was like oh my gosh this is like full circle moment that is so sweet behive is like I love the company they their founder is awesome to can you talk a little bit about digital products I think a lot of people create digital products and they don't turn out the way they want I think a lot of people comes down to distribution of course have you ever had a digital product just flop and then like what did you do about it and how did you create a better one I think there's like a lot of mistakes I made with the master class actually um I did not like how it turned out but it's okay I learned a lot from it because like some of the emails I sent it was like the worst emails in my life but I was like whatever this is just you know I'll learn from it but it was too like it sounded a bit scammy which I think was okay cuz PE some people trusted me but I lost a lot of subscribers after sending emails about my master class and being like hey you know learn how to make money online because it sounds so scammy um and the open rides plummeted a bunch of people unsubscribed like there was a big dip you can see in my beehive um I'll show you I think I tweeted about it I was like you can literally see the dip but then also we made made over $1,000 yeah during that dip so I was like you know you can see this big dip right here I lost hundreds of subscribers right here you think it's because of the copyrighting because the content itself was like yeah it was good so it was definitely that but also I think the landing page could have been improved so it was RJ's landing page actually not mine like his gum Ro and everything but like I don't like how the image was so so big and then it tells you nothing so I'm like I could cuz I do landing pages for work and AB testing and like conversion we optimization I'm like there's so much that we could improve here but you know gum Ro has a lot of limitations so I was like whatever this is the first time and we'll improve it later um and then a lot of people actually messaged me after I promoted it on Instagram and I sent them the DM with a link they were like oh I don't know how to like sign up or like I don't know how to get this because they were on mobile and then you have to like scroll all the way to the bottom and then I was like this is just too much fiction like the ux is really bad yeah like I have a whole bunch of learnings in my premium newsletter somewhere outlining all the mistakes I'll share as someone who bought um I think the timing of your viral tweet is the right word but the timing was like enough for me to say this person is going to I'm going to learn something from this person uh you know it's also very affordable $29 is a great price I even think I I would have paid like slightly more but I think it was right on the money RJ actually wanted to charge like way more but I was like there's no way he's way used to like higher pricing I'm used to cuz like from work we sell online courses and it's only like 49 USD or something like that and even then we struggle to get sales because people are like this is too expensive so I'm like you know I'm used to the lower tier pricing so I'm in this um I'm in this weekly entrepreneur group with like all these like Taiwanese people and um and one guy wanted to ask this so I hope you don't mind she's like um she has beehive on her main landing page but then she links out to passion fruit and lemon squeezy depending on certain links you choose is that a strategic choice or what's the reason for that I feel like half the things I do is just random and it works but um it's just I wanted a place for people to reach out to me to sponsor me and then a place for like that's the BB and then a place for people to buy from me so that's BTC because what I noticed was I have this website this beehive site linked in my bio on Instagram so every time people comment on my post they're like oh I can't find your templates even though like the post it says like there's a template so they have to click into it and but it's too many clicks so that's why I was like oh I should probably link my storefront there and then that way they can just click once and then see all the templates in one place instead of having to sift through all my other posts including the premium posts but even you know that's like still multiple clicks so now what I try to do is like I say DM me this keyword and I'll DM you the direct link to purchase so they just have to click the purchase button and that's it um but I haven't like I need to improve the website a lot it's just I'm sorting out some technical issues with my domain name and like other stuff and I'm like this is not worth my time right now when I could be getting like thousands of dollars from sponsors so I'm like emailing sponsors more then I'm like fixing up my website which isn't really going to bring me money right now so it's just picking where to work on that's higher leverage which is why I did that whole financial planning thing that I shared earlier yeah no that's really smart I just have a few last things these can be rapid fire um what's your average net profit margin on an average month 97% okay I I just did this calculation I saw that on your Twitter I was like holy  that's crazy because usually platforms take like 5 10% at least you know so um and I don't need to spend too much that's that's smart startup cost to start this whole thing um I just pay for beehive which is like 99 a month and then my DM automation tool which is like 65 a month I paid for cap cut for a meme effects that I wanted but that video didn't even do well so I'm not GNA continue paying for that okay yeah um and then the last one was going to be your Tex stack which you kind of touched on but I'm curious what what's okay I have a whole page this is also on my storefront but it's like free on my storefront so this is my Tex stack um everything that well most things that I use are here except I don't really use calendly anymore um some of these are affiliate links though but I can send this to you can you kind of tips or advice for people newsletters are so hot right now they're like all the buzz right I think it's just to stay consistent and then like look at the data and then like adjust accordingly is um like I feel like I started years ago and it really sucked like nobody was watching anything but since I stuck with it almost every day for years and it finally paid off so um it's just like staying consistent mainly was that posting content or writing that you were doing both okay um so I wrote Every for my Works newsletter every single week and that got me cuz I experimented with longer content but it kind of felt very convoluted and nobody understood what I wrote so that's why all of my newsletters now they have a lot of headings and it's like very easy to read there's like bullet points there's images and stuff so um you'll just improve the more consistent you are and it doesn't have to be like every day it can just be every week or every month perfect I think that's amazing advice yeah if there's anything you want to add feel free to call it out basically I've been building in public and getting lots of good advice from people so I know not everyone's comfortable sharing so much stuff in public but um that's really helped me because somebody told me to validate because I was like I don't know if I want to do agency work but let me try it out to validate that concept someone told me to sign up for Mentor quiz which was a website I didn't know was a thing so I signed up and not I didn't expect to get anything but I actually have two mentors now I pric myself too low again but um you know a few hundred a month extra from that and it's been really cool just seeing people's problems because they also want to start up side hustles but I'm like oh my God like I don't know how to tell you this but you're doing a lot wrong and I'm going to like try and help them like as a mentor so it's just like you know that's why I said take action is so important because you know you have to like do that to get data and to validate your assumptions and I feel like a lot of people stuff and then they try to distribute it and go but it's like oh you you didn't build the right thing I think I've learned that you know you you do the meaningless stuff build the website you tweak the colors the fonts and it's like that's not going to lead to sales that's not going to lead to business growth ultimately so yeah I think my first startup which was also in education I worried too much about the small stuff so I was like you know agonizing over which words to use in emails and and stuff but it's like that doesn't even matter so my second one like this one I focused on distribution first and I figured out all the products and everything else after see that that may be a grave mistake that I'm making because I just wanted to do this to meet me people and now that I'm trying to figure out monetization it's like well I don't have distribution to hear customer feedback and have this like flywheel feedback in product creation um did you study marketing and like did you go to university um I did study marketing and um it but I learned Facebook ads from losing $10,000 with my first shoe company uh and then got traumatized and then signed up for uh this boot camp to learn Facebook ads and then like scaled that Che business to like 25k a month uh with my best month being like 48k and organic sales but I burnt out too too hard it was like I did everything so wrong but I learned Facebook ads and then I learned SEO on my own and then um I also learned email marketing with that first business but with digital products I still make that mistake of trying to create the product first and then drive distribution yeah just let me know how I could provide value and I really hope you hit that 20K Mark sooner than later yeah I hope so too we'll see have a good night you too have a good one talk to you later bye

hey guys it's frey here helping you build a smarter workflow for your online business one of the biggest reasons i struggled learning facebook ads when i was just kind of learning the skill was because i was looking at the wrong metrics pretty much relying on the default dashboard view and when i found out that you can actually customize your dashboard and include all these different metrics my entire performance started to increase and grow because other metrics can tell you things like if your landing page is the problem in your entire equation or if your ad creative is the problem if you feel like your ads aren't performing at the level that you want and aren't generating the returns that you want it could really help to just spend 10 minutes and optimize your dashboard so that you can look at the relevant metrics that are affecting your ads so what i'm looking at here is the default dashboard that everyone sees when they sign up for their facebook ads manager so the default metrics are bid strategy budget results reach impressions cost per result and all these other ones on this top row here the truth is that if you just base your advertisement performance on just these metrics alone it doesn't give you the full picture you know you're looking at half of these metrics and you're probably thinking well which ones do i even pay attention to and why are these even relevant to help me improve my ads if you watch my videos you know that i believe facebook ads are composed of pretty much three different pillars and it's essentially just your interest targeting your landing page slash website experience and your ad creative these metrics should be able to point to one of those three pillars and say hey your ad creative is being watched like for two seconds when it's a 15 second ad two seconds is not very long so maybe it's the ad creative that is making your ad not convert or maybe you have a lot of add to carts and not purchases and you're probably wondering what's happening there this could mean that your user experience on your website or landing page is not really addressing the customers needs and wants it could also point to maybe something on your website that is not very trustworthy there could be a lot of reasons so you really have to dive into your landing page and figure that out but my point is at least it can narrow down and you can work on it and and fix it so i'm going to show you real quick the dashboard that i created and i actually learned this from some facebook ad experts and so it's not my idea it's not my original idea now here is my optimized facebook dashboard for you and i'm just going to take a moment and just read you guys the different metrics that i included in this customized dashboard starting from delivery we have bid strategy budget amount spent purchase row as very very important metric purchase conversion value cost per purchase website purchases cost per unit checkout unique checkouts initiated cost per ad to cart unique ads to cart outbound clicks cost per outbound click outbound click through rate cost per milli impressions reach frequency and video average play time so now that we know what our optimized facebook dashboard looks like let's go ahead and build that out and we're just going to go ahead and go up to your columns area and go to the very bottom where it says customize columns and here you can see all the current metrics that the default view has i'm just going to go ahead and delete all of them and the thing is half of these we're going to see again when we're building this but half of them are honestly irrelevant alright so clean slate we got delivery just type in delivery right here go ahead and check that and it populates the next one is add set name next one's bid strategy bid strategy budget amount spent purchase row as purchase row as let's click total here and then uncheck this one right here so the next one is purchases conversion value so i'm going to click value here and then it's going to do purchases conversion value and i'm just going to go ahead and click off these next is cost per purchase so i'm gonna do purchases and cost just the cost button and here we see that okay so the next one is website purchase and i click total under purchases i'll keep website purchases checked the next one is cost per unique checkout initiated so i'm going to type in check out and it says checkouts initiated and i'll do cost right here and then unique checkouts initiated so i'm also going to do check outs checkouts and then i'll do a unique now i'm doing cost per add to cart so i'm going to do add to cart and i'm going to do cost and then the next one's unique adds to cart which i can click unique the next one's outbound clicks outbound clicks right here this one's cost per outbound click so outbound uh cost per outbound click right here outbound click-through rate oh right here outbound click-through rate cpm i think we can just type in cpm perfect cpm and impressions is next reach frequency and lastly video average play time average play time bam all right now just to kind of run it back real quick we're looking at delivery ad set name bid strategy budget amount spent purchase row as return on ad spend purchases conversion value cost per purchase purchases with website purchases checked cost per checkout initiated unique checkouts initiated cost per ad to cart unique ads to cart outbound clicks cost per outbound click outbound click-through rate cost per milli cpm impressions reach frequency and lastly video average playtime from here you can go ahead and click the save as preset and just type in i like to type it in as optimized and you can click apply now we can see our new dashboard it's looking pretty spunky so when you log back into your facebook ads manager it will be on the default view so every single time you log in you just have to go to columns and then click optimize bam now you have your brand new shiny dashboard view and you should be able to start optimizing your ads i hope that was valuable and i really do think that everyone should do this it's one of those things where it's so quick and actionable and it could change your entire experience as an advertiser so go on and do this and start looking at the right relevant metrics and that's pretty much it

hey guys it's Frey and today I want to talk about which chat bot is the best for writing code emails my full-time job involves a lot of cold emails and if you're in sales you probably have the same situation going on you're trying to find different levers or different things about the individual that you can include to build that Rapport so in this video we're going to test three different chat Bots we have of course chat gbt we have copy.ai and we have perplexity.ai if you haven't heard of the last two copy.ai was very early in the whole AI scene I actually made a video on them two years ago now when they were running off gpt3 and perplexity.ai is one that I stumbled upon recently their whole thing is they are making search more personal now when it comes to sales you definitely want to appear like you know the person that you're reaching out to you want to make them feel like your services or your product is specifically designed find for people just like them so in this video we're going to be testing those three different chat Bots now the way I'm going to test this is by doing a quick experiment now the goal is to feed each chatbot a LinkedIn URL where we are going to ask it to scan the person and tell us everything that they know about that lead or that Prospect and then from the information that that chatbot can detect we are going to turn that into a cold email where it looks and feels and sounds way more personal like where their friend asking them if they'd be interested in our product or service here are some of the prompts that I created the first prompt is really just to say tell me everything you know about this LinkedIn URL and I copy and paste a URL for a leader Prospect in this case I'm just going to use my own I'm going to be testing each chatbot based on how accurate it can read the LinkedIn URL because that is the first step of creating an introduction so for the first prompt chat gbt has gotten a lot of things wrong first of all it says that I'm in San Francisco I'm the head of business operations at Mercury never worked there McKinsey and Corp as a consultant I have a Bachelor of Science in mechanical engineering from Berkeley basically Chachi BT has made me sound way more accomplished than I actually am I mean as as much as I want that to be true uh it's not you know I went to a state school and I don't have an MBA so it is what it is you know this problem is one of the biggest criticisms with with Chachi BT right now which is that oftentimes it hallucinates which is what people call um in the industry but it basically means that it's just wrong it's flat out incorrect not a great start for chai gbt now let's check copy.ei so here it's scanning my LinkedIn education University of Riverside degree in Business Administration skills sales Business Development Legion says overall Fray appears to be a sales development representative with a background in e-commerce and a strong interest in AI he's worked for companies such as stage intact copy.ai and tastemaker supply all right so copy.ai actually got a lot of things correct I will say the education part is wrong pretty much all the other skills and this little summary at the very end is accurate which means that copied AI is able to read pretty accurately some of my LinkedIn page so now we're going to try perplexity.ai but let's go ahead and create a new thread the provided LinkedIn URL leads to the profile Freight view unfortunately without access to the profile it's not possible to know more about the person or their professional experiences so right off the bat perplexity.ai is unable to read my LinkedIn page while perplexity wasn't able to read my LinkedIn you know I basically clicked on these related prompts right here and it actually now pulls my LinkedIn profile and is able to read it seems like perplexity has the ability to read a URL but you have to kind of dig for it a little bit deeper I didn't expect them to be the best to be completely honest I think they're way more useful for General queries if you just typed in hey what's the best camera for under 500 those kind of General queries are are way more interesting in perplexity but something more personal like the LinkedIn gonna have to give it a thumbs down for now here's the second prompt okay this looks a little bit long so this is what I'm gonna do we got the good old stopwatch dear friend too I was impressed by your experience in fintech and your current robots the head of business operations at Mercury as a website redesign Services included so so that took 23 seconds just to get through half of that email it's weird because typically Chad gbt is actually pretty good at following the prompt parameters but it gave me a couple doozies here first the subject line way too long and not very personable due to the hallucination that I had with the first prompt the first sentence is just totally wrong the second sentence does a good job of telling the prospect what you can do for them overall it's just really too long breaks that 15 second rule now let's go over to copied IAI and give it the prompt okay let's see okay so that's not bad at all I think it's a little bit long right it's kind of got the same issue as Chachi BT but what I do like about this email is saying hey I noticed and then inserts a personal fact about them as far as scanning a URL this is definitely the best so far wow copy.ei does hallucinate to some degree it's definitely still the most accurate by far it's able to use that information and remember that going forward as you ask it for more props now it's perplexity's turn after feeding the second prompt it says dear future I came across your LinkedIn profile and was impressed by your experience in email marketing and SEO the biggest beef I have with this specific output is the tone is really robotic as a website redesigned service provider we understand the importance of a website this last prompt gave me an idea what if we could actually ask it to create these emails to sound more casual conversational maybe closer to someone that we know is a really good writer one of those writers is Mark Manson the author of The subtle art of not giving a we're going to write a different prompt we're going to say rewrite this email in the tone and style of Mark and this is chat gbt's response to this it's a little bit long but it's kind of funny see this is where Chad gbt shines right if you're selling Design Services copywriting SEO I think this is totally acceptable maybe you shave off a little bit so it's not so long personally I would respond to an email like this over an email like the perplexity one any single day of the week let's uh let's give this to copy.ei now hey there I hope you're doing well I want to touch base with you about the content we discussed for a website as you know creating great content requires a lot of research thinking and expertise okay a little bit underwhelming I kind of expected a little bit more from copy.ai I think the biggest problem here is that the tone of this email kind of assumes that we're like too close there's less like here's what we can do for you and hey you know we're gonna get along so great your website's gonna look fantastic you know we're so good at what we do we're experts so I can't wait to start this project it's like a little bit too presumptuous a second try didn't really help that much I think as far as tone in style chat to BT still kind of hidden on the nail now going to perplexity.ai let's give it a try hey Frey I stumbled upon your LinkedIn profile and I was impressed by your experience in email marketing and SEO as someone who turns words into dollars I understand the importance of a website I think it's a little bit better than the last one but it definitely doesn't resemble the Mark Manson that we really wanted to another thing is that it's just weird as someone who turns words into dollars I mean maybe it's fine maybe I'm just giving giving these guys a hard time but not good enough to be usable but good enough to take small bits of inspiration not great on tone not great on factual correctness it's just okay okay now the last prompt here is we're going to ask it to create a sequence and this is for situations where they just don't respond typically email marketing is not one where you'll just hit a sale on the first one right so you want to be persistent continue to check in and that's what we're going to ask it to do let's do chat gbt first these are pretty solid Chad qbt produced one that starts off with hey just a quick follow-up on my email are you still interested I like the subject lines a lot better in this one it says don't miss out on our website redesign offer basically keeps it really short to say hey just checking in in case you forgot about us are you still interested in this if you are I'd love to chat the fourth email subject line is great limited time offer website redesign services so it gives you an idea of hey if they're at all kind of on the fence you can try to use a discount or a limited time offer to try to reel them in to see if that Garners any interest I wouldn't start the sentence off by this is our final email in our sequence I would just say hey this is the last time I'll bug you about our redesigned Services I'd love to help in case you're interested let's schedule a call so here's copy.ai we have first email checking in just wanted to follow up on my previous email to see if you had some time to chat about your website redesign needs perfectly good that's solid this is the third and final email I'll be sending if you're still interested last chance I want to give you one last chance to discuss your design needs I don't like how the third email says third and final follow-up and then it continues to do two more emails you'd probably have to write a prompt that corrects this and says hey don't you know include in the subject line that it's the final follow-up unless you're at the very last email the other thing with these is that it can end the emails with a question rather than saying hey looking forward to working with you you always want to end in a question right you want to always ask them a question to see if they'll engage but for the first output not bad not bad last is perplexity.ei quick follow-up I hope this email finds you well I want to follow up with our previous email I want to check in and see if you have any questions we'd love to help you improve our website okay I like that okay so the subject lines are just second third follow-up fourth follow-up obviously not not ideal right for I don't want to be a pest but I wanted to follow up one last time fifth I haven't heard back from you so I'm assuming you're you're not interested in our website redesign Services if you change your mind feel free to reach out I actually really like what we have here especially that fourth and fifth email you're almost also reinforcing this fact that hey I'm busy I'm not going to continue chasing you but if you're interested then let me know if they express a little bit of interest and then they could they go stew which happens pretty often it's a really good idea to follow up with email and say you know if this project is important for you then let me know now let's talk about some takeaways copy.ai without a doubt has the greatest ability to read a LinkedIn URL it was able to get the most accurate information on my LinkedIn without hallucinating or getting factual errors it said that I went to UC Riverside and when I did not go to UC Riverside but other than that the skills and the summary that it provided with the LinkedIn URL that I gave it was very very accurate to who I am as a person Chachi BT and perplexity on the other hand could not read the information or if they did it was just super wrong it was on mushrooms or something it was hallucinating Chad gbt on the other hand has such a way with words you know it's like almost a poet it's just so smooth it almost reminds me of you know John Mayer on the guitar it's just so effortless in its ability to mimic someone's style and tone perplexity is probably the least impressive out of all these I kind of knew going in that it had the underdog stamp on top of it but it did do pretty well kind of towards the end when we asked it to create sequences of emails so what does this all mean and what do I actually suggest going forward now that I've played with these different tools first off if we're just talking about functionality and not price then you can use different types of chat Bots for different purposes like for my full-time job I spend a lot of time on LinkedIn doing prospecting and cold emails if I need to very quickly write a personal email and I want to scan someone's LinkedIn URL you bet your butt I'm going to go with copy.ai I would then take the summary that it gave me feed it into chat gbt to create the style and tone of who I'm writing it to right I will leave a link for copy.ai down below if you want to try it out it is a paid software they also have a ton of other tools like over 90 different AI tools so you're kind of like getting whole full Suite solution of AI tools there perplexity is free so definitely go check that out I'll leave that leave a link down there below I have a great Chrome extension that I'll probably make a video about in the future and of course chat gbt you know where to find them with that guys I hope you enjoyed this video I try to spend a little bit of time each week looking at different AI stuff as it relates to sales and marketing specifically so if you like this kind of content make sure to

what most people do when they set up their ads is they do something different for every one of these three and then when you ask them well why don't you think your ads aren't working they don't know where to point right they don't know if it's the audience the copy or creative that's going wrong what's up guys it's spray here helping you build a smarter workflow for your online business today we are going to dive into a topic why your facebook ads are not working for the longest time i actually was the biggest hater on facebook ads i was one of those people who were like it doesn't work it will never work for my product my customers aren't on the platform all these excuses that you know you hear people talk about i'm going to invite you into checking out my own facebook ad account i think that it will just establish some credibility with my own experience with ads these are the sales that i've gotten from this much of ad spend so looking at the last 30 days uh today it's november 6th you can see that i spent just over 1300 on my ads and i have gotten around five thousand dollars in sales which is a return of around 3.82 so let's dive into three reasons why your facebook ads might not be working so the first reason your facebook ads are not working is because you continued to release the same creative while expecting a different result actually the first 12 thousand dollars in ad spend was used making this mistake i i made maybe two or three different creatives didn't change too much about my campaigns and expected people to purchase based around the seasons and the holidays when it really was an issue of what i was putting out now the second reason is very similar to the first reason which is you're not trying enough variations you're not varying your audience targeting your creative or your ad copy so let's see if we can elaborate a little bit more on the second point on one end you got you got your audience right here right and then you have your ad copy and then you have your creative right maybe this is a video um it could be a photo as well what most people do when they set up their ads is they do something different for every one of these three and then when you ask them well why don't you think your ads aren't working they don't know where to point right they don't know if it's the audience the copy or creative that's going wrong the way that we approach this is that we first i like to first figure out the creative i want to figure out what kind of video or photo is getting me more views more clicks just more engagement if it's a video you can check average video watch time to see how long they're watching it what i recommend is you create a ton of creatives maybe 10 different creatives or what i do is i'll make three different videos but make them super super nice quality and then you start to play right so let's say just within this you're you're testing out this circle you also have these different videos that you want to test you know these are three different videos you want to test in order to test this you need to keep these variables constant audience and copy you need to make sure that this is a circle this is a circle this is a circle similarly you go here and then you test this with this method you want to know of this creative which one of these three is working the best for you because maybe this one is watched for two seconds this is watching for four seconds this is watching for seven seconds so you're like okay well the square is performing really well i know that's the winning creative because i've tested it with a bunch of different audiences and with the same copy so at this point you know that this is pretty much your winner once you have found your winning creative so to speak you can then start to experiment with the different with the different variables now this time you might just want to stick with the same creative because you've already found something right and this time you want to test your test out your audience so this time we are going to let's just bracket this off so we know it's one campaign i guess these brackets can can represent a campaign the next thing we can test is the audience where we do something like this we test out different audiences right the general idea with the audience is that you just find really any audience in the beginning that kind of has to do with your target audience for me i'm in the ethical fashion industry so i target people like pita like animal cruelty plant milk so you have these different kinds of audiences now that you're trying to test you're keeping these creatives the same and you're also using the same copy because we want to be able to test this right we're able to isolate this variable this is already good we don't even need to work on this anymore um well we do but not for the sake of this example this is still a question mark and this is what we're currently working on the way you tell that you have a winning audience is simply by how many of these audiences have the most purchases maybe you only sell one thing here but you sell three things here and you sell two things here well now this is a great audience you know the way you tell an audience is clear is you look at the the roads you need to be able to know if the return is is worth the cost of the ad but that's getting into a little bit more high level thinking this is a very basic illustration of what you need to do let's say this is the winner right well finally let's block this off for one last time well finally we can work on the copy now you for the third campaign you are keeping the winning audience you're keeping the winning creative and now the variable is this the copy then you can really test to see which one will convert that's kind of the strategy the step-by-step strategy with how you can start to see some success with your facebook ads um i hope that kind of cleared things up for you so the third reason your facebook ads aren't working is because of your landing page your website experience is either super terrible it's not clicking with the visitor or it's not addressing the customer's needs and concerns you know in my case i sell shoes online and i know people who their first question is what kind of material you use is it durable is it comfortable is there free shipping or free returns they need to know the answers to these questions to even consider purchasing if they land on your website and they start having these different questions and they're not being answered on that product page or on that landing page then they're just going to dip out they're going to bounce they're going to leave without purchasing all right guys hopefully that illustration helped you understand how to set up your facebook ads going forward and don't worry take it easy learn a little bit and progress each day because facebook ads is a whole language and it's not something that is easily learned just doing it for a couple days if you guys enjoy this content i would appreciate a quick thumbs up it helps this content reach other people who might want to use it or need it so with that guys hopefully you guys have a great weekend and tune in tomorrow because i'm doing this every single day have a good one guys see ya

so here is one of my products with vegan leather as i brand it but um essentially it is like this really high grade microfiber that's used in car seats like tesla tesla cars and i essentially repurposed it for a shoot so let's get on with it hey guys my name is fray and welcome to my channel where i'm helping you build a smarter workflow for your online business you probably clicked because you are launching an apparel brand or you already have an apparel brand maybe you're early on i'm here to give you five tips or things that i wish i knew before i launched mine the first thing i wish i knew was that inventory is a risk before i launched my brand i was talking to my grandpa who lives in taiwan and he's an incredibly successful businessman like very very very successful one thing i remember him telling me when i told him i was launching a shoe business was he was cautioning me about inventory because a lot of his friends do apparel or any physical product really that contains a lot of different sizes and one of the biggest things and saddest things that happens is when you have a lot of inventory and you just can't sell it off because for many reasons right it's like the worst nightmare that you can have is when you just have a bunch of stuff sitting there it's happened to me with a couple different shoe styles where i thought they would sell well and now they're just kind of sitting there and i've had to donate thousands of pairs of shoes because of this exact issue now the second thing is to build an email list early it's more of a digital marketing thing to know but you need to build your email list in the beginning i was just focusing on growing my instagram i thought that's the only thing that mattered you got to start building an email list because ultimately on instagram facebook youtube pinterest you don't own these followings you definitely want to start creating this community this inner circle where you can start interacting with them and just engaging with them like building a relationship in real life it's way easier to resell to existing customers than it is to try to find new customers that's just a given fact uh if they're already a customer then you can resell them on something that you create in the future or that you have but you know maybe at a discount or something number three do your customer research i think it took me a really long time to understand the importance of this and know what the heck this even means but knowing your customer means you understand their lifestyle you understand where your product fits in their life what their goals are age demographic where they live what they're interested in what their values are a quick example is that i sell footwear that's in the vegan leather market so for the longest time i thought i was just selling to vegans right the vegan community here in la is boomin what i found was i'm actually targeting a larger subset of customers which falls under ethical fashion or sustainability people who either care for the environment or care for cruelty-free fashion and those things are way larger and broader than just selling to people who label themselves as vegan i have a video on how you can understand your customers really early on in owning your business so um you can check that out the fourth thing is solve a problem i feel like a lot of people right now especially my age are starting streetwear brands or apparel brands hoping to become like the next supreme or the hundreds the thing is that you want to make sure that you're not just selling your business on dope designs try to create multiple layers as to why people would buy from you for example if if i like your design but i only buy organic cotton or hemp as a material because i believe in the sustainability of that then i'm not going to buy your product even though i might really like your design so the fifth and the last one is to do it yourself before you hire every single thing that goes on in your business where you can eventually see yourself hiring out outsourcing to someone else you gotta do it yourself you gotta find a way to understand how that job works whether it be as simple as packing boxes taping them and shipping them out to the postal office to customer service to filming creating content to photography and the reason you have to do it yourself is because the only way you're not going to be taken advantage of is if you know exactly what needs to be done to get the job done how long it takes the expertise like videography if you were to hire a videographer it would really help to know if you know your way around a camera if you know the work involved in creating a good advertisement or video it's gonna make communication way easier and you're gonna not feel like you don't know what you're paying for especially this one can be super expensive because labor is one of the most necessary things you need to grow your business but it's also one of the most expensive things so make sure that you hire for things that you already know how to do so those are five things i wish i knew before launching my apparel brand when i was coming up with this video there's so many things that came to my mind but let me know if you want to see a part two because there's simply far more than just five things to know if you made it this far thank you i appreciate you and please hit that like button if you want to see more of this content and it also helps me get this content out to people who want to see it so do me that favor and hopefully you have a great week catch you in the next one see ya

hey guys it's fray and today I'm walking you through the app exchange with exchange it and I use this app almost every single day and it's really useful for physical product stores for when they want to exchange a product I'm just gonna go ahead and dive right in because it's a very simple to use app so you can go ahead and click on the link below or you can visit the Shopify app store so with exchange it it is a little bit of a different app because it doesn't directly boost your sales passively but what it does do is it saves a massive amount of time on your end as a store operator because exchanges are kind of annoying to deal with it's a lot of clicks you know once you actually install the app it actually builds into your back-end right here you can see exchange with exchange it appears right here and I'm gonna show you how quickly it is to handle an exchange for customer you simply head into the backend of your store click on the order so we're gonna go ahead and click on this this is order number 31 30 here we can break it down from the top we have our original order this is what the customer ordered typically how I handle exchanges is once the customer tells me hey I want to exchange this I'm gonna send them a return label once that package arrives at our warehouse I'm gonna go ahead and confirm that yes they did return this and from there I'm gonna go ahead and create an exchange order here yep they ordered this product they did return it to the warehouse let's say for example they just wanted to swap this shoe out for a size 10 instead of a size 9 we're gonna go under the exchange order choose the product name in this case it's taste add adventure the variant will be black suede because they ordered that originally and I'm gonna go with the black suede in size 10 actually so there it is and then here we will have all of their shipping address information copy and paste it here it's a blank because this is just a test order so all you have to do is place the exchange order I'm gonna put in a random address so that we can just complete this example so I just put out an address it's actually to Angel Stadium but go ahead and click place in exchange order so just to show you what it did this is the original order number three one three zero I asked it to exchange the shoe so it created a new order and we can go ahead and click on this it automatically creates a new order for the product that the customer wanted to exchange for and in this case it's the taste adventure size 10 in black that's pretty much it you can go ahead and create a shipping label the reason why it doesn't give me the option for shipping label and my example is because I left the shipping address blank but as long as you have a shipping address then you can go ahead and fulfill this order like a normal order go ahead and click on the link down below or you can check out exchange with exchange it on the Shopify App Store and I don't know I love this app what can I say it stays a bunch of time and with that hopefully you guys have a wonderful day stay persistent out there and I'll catch you guys in the next video see ya

here's the story of how I landed a corporate Tech job on my first try if you knew me you'd probably say wow Frey getting his first corporate Tech job that's kind of interesting and that's because out of college I took a nosedive into entrepreneurship and tried to run my own Footwear business for five years but you know things change and now I'm in a position where I can get a predictable income while building on the side but let me bring you back to the story of how this all happened this story has a little bit of luck a little bit of serendipity for those who don't want to watch the full video the SparkNotes version of the story is that I met a stranger off Facebook Marketplace I started to build rapport started to build a relationship with him and I ultimately found a way to negotiate a way to have him refer me to the job that I work for now kind of a long-winded story I know but I'm about to break it down [Music] just trying to get my shoes on right over here I'm going to quickly show you the vehicle for the product I should say kind of gave it away that uh resulted in a job this car back here this 2011 Subaru Outback is the reason I landed my first tech job I bought that car back in December 22. during this time I was in a pretty bad headspace I didn't have a car I didn't have a job I just closed my business I wasn't finding that anything was sticking in like in terms of earning an income it was just a really kind of a low point for my life really just overall low self-esteem right I think a lot of us can probably relate to that in just general life terms I scoured everywhere for a Subaru Outback especially one of that year especially one with that engine it's the 3.6R engine and I finally found this guy on Facebook Marketplace for the sake of this story let's call him Tom now there's a couple things that I did here to Prime him to kind of like help me think of anything related to job opportunities and the first one was before we actually met up now when it comes to such a big purchase I feel like trust is so challenging to build especially when you're just strangers right and so one thing that I did to sort of be more transparent while texting him I said you know I do want to take it to like a secondary shop I know you won't be able to join me because you're working so I'll have to drive your car you're basically going to have to trust me with your car for you know two to three hours while I get a secondary inspection on it in an effort to create more transparency I say hey Tom uh here's my LinkedIn and you can kind of see that I'm a real person here's all of my my work history and I kind of nudged him there you know I I'm kind of looking for something new so if you know anyone who's hiring then let me know I kind of Drew that as a joke uh in the text chat that was kind of like the first priming that I did I might have done a little bit of like LinkedIn stocking on his profile noticed that he was you know in software sales which is something that I actually was looking at some some form of sales either medical sales or software sales fast forward to when I actually meet him in person I noticed that you know he has this life together and I nudge him again I kind of slide into the conversation look like you know the car is beautiful I love the car hey if you know someone who's hiring I'd love to chat um kind of looking for something new right now and that was the second priming that's kind of when he asked me questions like oh like well what are you trying to get into and I said you know probably something in the sales world that's something that I I think I'd be good at and he's like I'm actually in software sales and we just happened to be hiring that is that's like some manifesting energy right there or something right that is just luck whatever you want to call it we built the relationship from then we got business finished I got the car looked at it was all clean beautiful records yeah basically it came down to negotiation and and because I knew he wasn't willing to budge on price I needed to come up with a more creative way to actually negotiate for this car and so what I did the night before I drove down to San Diego was I took all of my most valuable things I'm talking about things like my Canon cameras my iMac some Pokemon cards some shoes just a bunch of random stuff that is like pretty valuable and I looked up the fair market value on eBay the actual fair market value of what it sells for and I put a Post-It note wrote the price and stuck it on the item and I threw all those items into the trunk of my sister's car which I used to drive down to San Diego so when it came down to to it I said hey Tom I have a trick up my sleeve would you come follow me to the trunk of my car real quick and he's like oh man are you gonna try to negotiate and I was like I mean maybe a little bit but just just come with me and see what I have to offer so he follows me to the trunk of my car I open the trunk and there's all my stuff with all the Post-it notes it's like a general store and I said look I know you weren't really willing to budge with price but you know I'm trying to stay cash heavy right now and I brought my most valuable Goods that I own so are you into photography do you shoot Canon do you shoot Nikon you know tell me a little bit more about yourself and he said I do have a Canon camera I'm like great um how about Pokemon cards how about shoes and he's like I'm good on that like let's just focus on the Canon lenses that you brought long story short I sold him on like 2500 roughly of Canon camera lenses really beautiful like top-notch L lenses L Series lenses which we call in the Canon world that are kind of like the cream of the crop as far as uh photography I sold him on a bunch of camera equipment that he wasn't really prepared to accept but accepted because it just happened to be this serendipitous moment where he was trying to get back into photography anyways he owned a Canon camera already and I just kind of came into his life at the perfect time the very next day it's car time right I I bring my mom my sister we drive down to San Diego I'm super excited thinking like there is no way I'm not gonna have a car by the end of the day I am going to leave San Diego as a new car owner that is 100 what's happening as I'm driving down I get a text from him like 10 minutes before I arrive and he says look here's what I'm willing to offer for the car 9 500 the camera lenses that you gave me that I've been playing with plus a referral to a software sales position at the company that I work for and I was like holy um you know when I first thought about it I was like wait there it is kind of an unknown with the referral I don't know what he's going to say about me I don't know how much poor influence he has uh inside the company uh to really get me this job I was just a little bit skeptical because a referral could mean a lot or could mean a little bit but I knew in the back of my mind that referrals made up a majority or like at least 50 percent of how jobs are gotten nowadays and so I was like look you know I'm looking for a change let's do it so I met up with him and he's like what'd you think about the offer I said I think that's totally fair let's shake on it we took on it did the whole exchanging of details I left San Diego as a new car owner and I still love that freaking car I I think it's like Subaru Outbacks are amazing cars in general so just in four months I've gotten a new job I've moved out of my parents house um I'm way like mentally healthier I just I'm just in a better spot and I have a car that is like just insane the amount of change that can happen so quickly I still keep in touch with him turns out he's really like a top performer within the company I would message him in you know Microsoft teams and I'd be like yo what's up and he's like yo like from Facebook Marketplace to uh you know the company that we work at and it's just such a beautiful beautiful moment that is the story of how I landed my first corporate Tech role and kind of rerouted my whole life let me take a moment to debrief though I just told you a story that has a lot to do with luck that has a lot to do with timing and things that don't seem like they're out of our control I think there's a different way to look at it too I think you can look at it as luck will always play a factor but meeting humans is sort of like the key to opportunity there were moments in that same week where I would again slide into the conversation the fact that I'm looking for a job and people would literally offer me jobs like I remember I talked to one guy at the DMV it was a DMV service for for registering the car so it wasn't like a regular DMV where like you know everyone's just like kind of depressed and you know whatever if this guy had his own business to expedite the process and I I told him like Hey look I'm looking for a new job like if you know anyone and he's like well actually you know I'm starting a coffee shop I need a full-time like marketer social media person who can make videos and content I was like almost like entertained by that too because I have background in that from running a business I had to do a lot of that my point is that humans are so slept on for some of us maybe we realize they're not slept on and we understand that's the key unlock but it's just like how do we actually meet people that's the hard part how do we actually meet people who hold the positions that can refer us to the jobs that we want a lot of that is out of your control but what's not out of your control is taking that active step to nudge someone to slide into that conversation what your wants and needs are even if it was like forcefully trying to meet people you know you could technically go on Facebook Marketplace purchase items that you could then resell just to have that human interaction and the reason I think that's not an insane idea especially with like a car purchase you know it's a it's a large ticket item but with even smaller purchases there are only a few hundred dollars or even less you always will want to trust the person on the other end the reason I say the larger ticket items are more interesting is because you know with a car you you want to be able to trust the person you're selling to and the person that you're buying so you're you're naturally inclined to build a relationship to the point where you can say hey I can co-sign mentally intuitively emotionally that the person that I am transacting with is is a good person so that's why I don't I don't think it's a crazy idea use Facebook Marketplace or other forms of like Marketplace to buy and sell people as an in to meet them and tons of different people buy and sell off Facebook Marketplace don't assume that just because you're selling used Goods that you know you're not in a good job and you're struggling financially and you need to sell secondhand Goods to like you know pay your rent or stuff like that no so that is my story of how I when I did my first

what's up guys it's frey and today i'm going to show you how to set up your facebook pixel go ahead and go to business.facebook.com and create an account it'll kind of walk you through the steps and then you will be good to go once you create a business account you will land to this page so from here i'm going to go ahead and create a business it's going to ask for some business information so go ahead and fill it out real quick and once you actually create your account you're going to be looking at this page right here you can see it's all brand new no ad accounts or anything so let's just go up to this little top right corner under business settings i'm going to go ahead and click on that the first thing we need to do before we actually install our pixel is we need to make sure all of our settings are correct and we link it to our facebook page if we have one uh link it to our instagram page once we added the page it's asking us if we want to link our facebook page as well as our instagram page so i'm just gonna go ahead and add both of them but if not what you can do is just simply go under the instagram account section under accounts on the left hand side and then you can go ahead and add your instagram page here so here we can see all vegetarian ink my facebook page is connected so once you add your facebook page go ahead and go to the ad account section where you will add an account so for you you're probably going to have to click the first option which is add an ad account now the reason why it's great out for me is because i just made one and if you just created a new business account then they're not going to let you create multiple ad accounts for some reason so you just have to make sure and go through the ad account process here alright so that's pretty much it so just to recap all we have to do before we test for our pixel is make sure that under pages we have our facebook page connected our ad account created for the business that we want and lastly our instagram account connected and that is it so from here we can go ahead and install our facebook pixel and to do that we're just going to go under the business settings section and go under events manager and we're going to get started right here we're just going to go ahead and click continue so from here go ahead and click add code using partner integration and here we can see all the different integrations that facebook ads can connect to you now i'm gonna be connecting my facebook pixel to my shopify website so go ahead and click on shopify so they're gonna give you this pixel id which can be found right under here and go ahead and copy and paste this and we're going to paste it into our website so go ahead and move on over to your shopify website under online store you will find a section called preferences so go ahead and click on that scroll down to the facebook pixel section and go ahead and paste your pixel like that and don't forget to save it right after now most people stop here because they think okay i put in my facebook pixel id and it's pretty much finished i'm good to go however you still need to test this pixel and make sure that it's firing off when it needs to to do that we're gonna head back to our facebook business manager and go ahead and click continue once you actually install that facebook id it's gonna ask you to verify the pixel is working so go ahead and plug in your website mine is called veganfraw.com so it's gonna send some test traffic it's pretty much testing to see that every single visitor that comes from a facebook link will be tracked through the facebook pixel here we can see that my pixel is working correctly it has that green dot that is great news we're on a great track right now now the last step is to make sure that it's testing for conversions traffic for example when someone clicks the add to cart button we want to be able to track that go ahead and click view setup instructions right here you can exit this part out this is really the page that i want to be at from here you want to go to the settings tab scroll all the way down to the event setup section and from here we want to open event setup tool right here it's going to ask for your website so go ahead and type it in right here it's going to redirect you to a new page on your website and this little window is going to pop up the first thing i want to do is actually go to my product page here we have a little shop now section so i'm going to click on any single product right here so from here i'm going to go ahead and click track a new button right here and it's gonna pop up this weird looking screen where it's pretty much gonna ask you which button you wanna label from here i'm gonna click on add to cart and i'm gonna click on this add to cart button on this pop-up window and confirm that so what i just did is i just labeled this button and every single other add to cart button on my website now our facebook pixel will pick up any single visitor that clicks on the add to cart button now we want to label the checkout button because it's valuable to know when someone initiates a checkout and we're going to repeat that same process here so go ahead and click on the track new button section and click on the checkout we're going to select an event we're going to say initiate checkout because we're not quite yet at purchase so we're going to click on this it's going to ask you um if you want to choose a value on the page or don't include the value i actually just confirm it and i leave that alone i've never had any issues with that and now we can go on to pretend like we're checking out here we are this is the payment page of our website it's the final page that people go to before they click on the pay now button so we're going to repeat the same process click attract new button click on this pay now select an event and click on purchase confirm that and now we can finish the setup on this corner here these are the three different events that we had we have the add to cart the initiate checkout and the purchase this way when we create a campaign in the future we can actually create a campaign where the goal is to get purchases now the very last thing to do is actually test this event and make sure that they're firing properly we're gonna go over to the test events section on that left-hand side panel right here yeah we're gonna go ahead and test some events right here it's gonna ask you to open your website so let's go ahead and start testing this out and the way you test it out is pretty much going through that same process that you did when you labeled them so imagine that you're a customer and you're just scrolling through the website you're interested in purchasing some products so you add something into your cart right here click on the add to cart button click on the checkout button so i added something to my cart i initiated the checkout and now the only thing left to press is the pay now button but i'm not trying to pay 60 for a test so what i usually do is i just go into shopify and create a quick 100 discount code that i can use and i just created this right here uh and then i can go ahead and click pay now we're gonna click complete order right here this order is being processed just like i was a normal customer now that we went through that whole sequence we want to check to see if the facebook pixel actually tested correctly and we're going to head back to our facebook pixel where you actually want to look is go to the overview section right here and look down below in this area here we can see all these different green dots and when it says active that is what you're looking for here we have the page view it's active view content add to cart initiate checkout these pixels are firing correctly so right now all i'm waiting for is the purchase pixel to activate this is the most important one because the only thing i optimize for are purchases because i don't care about people coming to my website and not buying anything i just want to make sure that purchase pixel is firing off correctly so we're gonna go ahead and give it a little moment sometimes it can take 5 10 15 minutes to actually go through but if these went through then this one should go through two so i just came back about 10 minutes later and refreshed the page here we can see that the purchase pixel is green and it's fully active so that is exactly what we're looking for all these are beautiful and green so that's pretty much all you need to do to properly set up your facebook pixel and i'm going to show you really quickly why you had to go through each and every step by creating a sample campaign for you so the first thing you need to do when you start a campaign is decide what your objective is the number one objective that i run for is conversions because at the end of the day i only care about purchases this is where we need to make sure that pixel is firing properly here we can see all the different events that i tested for and the one that i want to choose for conversions is purchase now your facebook ad campaign will track every single purchase conversion that you're going to make in the future if you guys want to check out how i run my ads on facebook then i will have that in a separate video and with that guys thanks for watching and i'll see you guys in the next video see ya

hey guys it's fred here helping you build a smarter workflow for your online business in this video i'm going to show you the winning advertisement that is really working for me right now in november 2020 and i'm also going to show you the editing in premiere pro that i did to create this video as well as the actual return on ad spend that this advertisement is getting me so this is the advertisement i'm currently running that is getting me over for roads as we speak so take a look [Music] um a couple things before we dive into the actual editing part i want to show you the ad creative principles that are in play here which make this a pretty solid advertisement starting from the very beginning and by the way that's my girlfriend in the video she was helpful enough to help me out so if you have a wearable product just hit up your your friends or your partner and hopefully they can help you out so one of the things that i make sure to do when i'm making an advertisement especially a video advertisement like this is i make sure that within the first three seconds i can answer what product i'm selling so the product has to be in the shop second who it's for yeah vegan boots so if you're vegan or if you're into veganism then you like you associate with this video immediately and then a way to quickly and concisely describe the essence of of your product and your brand something that makes it maybe a little bit unique or that identifies a customer need you know product vegan booths made ethically that was like that's three seconds in right there that's actually two seconds in so i think the average attention span nowadays is like six seconds or something like that it's really short so you don't have too much time to show your product and give people an idea of what you're selling so the way i do that is through a mixture of video and quick little text all these slides here are hitting people where i know um they're curious about their curiosity will lead them to ask where these shoes are made for example so i'm just answering that right now for them so they don't have to do any more digging and what this does is that it really eliminates any barriers to get them to click and check out your website because if they have a lot of questions after hearing what you sell then they're probably not going to go check out your website because they're lazy right they don't want to do the extra digging and yeah i did rent out a professional studio here in la it's called fd studio and it was actually really affordable i think it was forty dollars for one hour now i'm gonna show you the behind the scenes here is my premiere pro thing [Music] hmm [Music] the whole advertisement is 20 seconds so it's not very long and i always try to keep it within 30 seconds or less for sure but i always try to keep it around 15 seconds so if you're familiar with premiere pro you can tell that the way i made this video super super simple like the formatting is extremely simple you can learn how to do this in less than a day even if you just started learning premiere pro now if you're not familiar with those are my dogs hold up hey what's up what are you guys doing if you've never used premiere pro ever in your entire life this might look very complicated you see all these colors and these blocks but essentially the blue blocks are your video so you just trim the parts of the video you want the green big block is the soundtrack and then in between these pink boxes are just text text boxes so if i click on this then it's that top box that's shop ethically and then one is also for my logo it's not a complicated video you don't need some crazy production all i did for this video was i went to a studio with my girlfriend i got some really good film with a gimbal you can probably even use i your iphone or your smartphone to to do this and i just added some text which names my selling points and that's pretty much it just make sure to hook them within the first three seconds and that's probably the most important part you want to use words where they're going to strongly associate themselves with those words for example vegan boots made ethically if i said like faux leather boots made in grease that's just too specific and like there's too many words that aren't easily associatable i don't know if that's a word every single word is very intentional to make sure that it aligns with my audience i'm going to show you some results that this video has gotten me i made this video really late october 2020 so i just launched it like two weeks ago i want to say and it's been performing pretty good the two campaigns i want you to pay attention to are this look-alike one and this prospecting one for women the reason why i want you to look at these two is because these are the two campaigns where i'm using this advertisement on so i've checked them so you can kind of see which ones i'm talking about but starting with this prospecting one i have spent 489 dollars and i've got over i have four point one for return on ad spend i've generated two thousand and twenty six dollars when i see this i'm like this is a solid advertisement because you know a return of four x is pretty good to me and really the return depends on your own product right you got to know your numbers and your break even but uh it kind of gives you an idea now the cost per acquisition the pr the cost per purchase is really good on these because you can see that on the prospecting one it's 34.97 on the look-alike one it is 32.57 i'm super happy with this because my products are more expensive the average purchase amount that i receive on my store is around a hundred and ten dollars so people on average spend 110 on my store so to have a cost per purchase of 32 or 35 dollars that's definitely solid because you can see these ones i mean my retargeting campaign 65 dollars my other interest one is 44. here so here okay wow so the video average play time is less than i thought so it's three seconds um for both of these campaigns just goes to show you can have a pretty short average play time this is actually this is actually pretty short man like this is actually making me think that i need to create another ad video or creative because before it was four and i think one at one point is even five seconds now i'm just going to show you my look-alike audience here we can see that it's working pretty good actually this campaign was sucking when it first was launched and look-alike audiences take a little bit of time to get it but look at this cost per purchase 26 dollars is like unreal and if i change the date to the last seven days uh it's even it's even lower you know this is a great return on ad spend 4.25 and here we can see yep three seconds again uh and yeah so you can tell it's doing pretty well i mean 358 dollars spent for 1500 i'll take that any day of the week that's kind of a quick look into my most successful advertisement right now i have tried a couple static photos for my shoes and they haven't worked as well but it's always good to test those hopefully that was helpful or interesting or entertaining i'll take either of those yeah i hope you guys start doing your facebook ads early because it's already november 10th and it's super important to get your ads cracking during the holiday season if you're still on the fence about doing facebook ads because of the rona then don't be because since november started actually late october i'm noticing no difference in uh consumer spending and my products are more expensive too they're like you know 100 200 for shoes and people are spending so that's what i can tell you and go out and make some bomb ads thanks for watching guys hit the like button if you got any value out of this it really helps me to promote my content more naturally organically and i think that's the way to do it so with that guys hit me up with any questions down below in the comment section and i'll catch you guys in the next video peace out

[Music] hey guys it's ray here and welcome to my channel where i talk about online business health and web design today i actually want to talk about drop shipping because it is a hot topic i know for a fact a lot of people are looking at drop shipping thinking hmm is this actually a viable job is this something that i can do in the next three four or five months and make a decent side hustle after trying it for a while i i've noticed some very very big disadvantages compared to different business models for those who don't know i started an e-commerce brand called tastemaker supply in 2017 and it is a completely private label footwear brand where we hold inventory we have a warehouse full of shoes that whole deal the growing pains of the company had really gotten to me and i was looking for something new which is when i stumbled on drop shipping i really got into the depth of it every single day i would spend like 10 hours literally completely invested it i pushed everything in my current business aside because i just wanted to know if it was truly what people were claiming to be here's what i learned first let's just address the get rich quick thing i mean obviously it's a big red flag and anytime you hear those words it kind of like triggers something in your brain maybe if you are already established in drop shipping you have the knowledge then you probably can get started very quickly you can build a website set up ads and you have a good relationship with a supplier you know a good product fit for a certain niche these are all good things to know that will probably get you going faster and get to success faster but if you're just starting out and you're just trying to learn how to make money online it's very very hard and i wouldn't believe people who tell you that it's a get rich quick thing if you break down the art of drop shipping it really boils down to a few different skills that you need one of the biggest ones is facebook ads that's the one that's most talked about the second one is web design knowing aesthetically what looks good copywriting wise seo wise and all these different things that make a great website turn into a great experience for the visitor you gotta know that the third thing is you gotta have a great relationship with your supplier or have some kind of negotiation skills communication skills at the very least it's pretty hard when you're just a small potato starting out you know who's going to want to negotiate with someone who doesn't have a history of orders or or sales if you break that down even further facebook ads by itself is an entire language there are so many different knobs and levers that you need to understand it's constantly changing there are creative aspects to it like the copy the video the static photo to technical skills that you need editing all that stuff and while you can outsource these things to other people like on upwork or fiverr it's not really a great idea because you don't really know what makes a good ad if you're constantly outsourcing to people then you're never really going to understand which parts of your work are not working now the second problem i have with drop shipping is brand and brand equity now what i mean by that is that when you're doing a drop shipping model you are pretty much outsourcing a lot of things right you're getting the product from usually a chinese factory overseas so you have nothing to do with how that product is made if you can make adjustments to that product that's not really within your realm you're pretty much just slapping your brand name something that you just created on an already existing product and you're trying to sell it to people at a better price or a better offer than other substitutes for that product when i think of what makes a great brand i think about what makes their product unique i think of their customer service i think about their values as a company who the founder is i think about where it's made and all those kind of you know things environmental impact that kind of stuff we live in a world right now where those things really matter and those affect the purchasing patterns of a lot of shoppers due to the nature of the drop shipping model you don't really innovate on the product at all like you can't say that you want to tweak anything you don't have control over the customer service because the factory in china or wherever your drop shipping from even in the us they're shipping the product directly to the consumer so you don't have control over getting it to them on time if they need it or returns in exchanges those become very very not so fun you definitely don't have any insight on the founder who he or she is their story why they started this business in the first place a great brand offers a fantastic solution to the world and even better brands are transparent about it you got to meet their owner you got to understand who they are you know where they're from you know their values all that kind of stuff associated with that individual so the third problem i noticed with drop shipping is that in my experience it was a race to the bottom pricing wise it's constantly like finding a way to underbid the person next to you in dropshipping there's a lot of people who are trying to do it it's a very low barrier to entry because you don't really need a ton of cost to get started your whole job is trying to sell a product that is being sold at a ton of other stores maybe even hundreds of different stores if it's a really hot product in a lot of cases people do have to smush down their prices lower than your competitors leaving you with slim to none profit margins to pocket you got to imagine these factories in china who are making these things let's say for example a cell phone holder for your car they're definitely doing the drop shipping model to hundreds of other people and if one of those people know how to sell it better then it's going to be very challenging because you know supply and demand there's way more supply than demand simple now the fourth problem i have with drop shipping is the customer service i bet if you've tried drop shipping before even if you've had some success with it you've run into some issues with drop shipping with customers who want to return or exchange products either because they're damaged or they're super late they're not going to arrive for like a month the reason why i'm so bullish with this is because customer service in my opinion is one of the most profitable strategies in any given business if you read the book by the zappos founder tony shea he based his whole business uh which is a billion dollar business around customer service and he grew in one of the most difficult economic times in 2008 no companies were growing people were being laid off like crazy and the economy was tanking he has a very customer-centric perspective when it comes to growing businesses and i've learned to adopt that as well because i've seen a ton of success with my footwear company just treating people well taking care of them even if it costs a little bit of money in the short term it almost always pays off in the long term in the form of a testimonial or word of mouth referral or just simply buying more product customer service is so hard with drop shipping because like i said you don't have control over the shipping times you're not the one physically shipping it you're not the one packing it you're not the one inspecting the product before it gets shipped to the customer for a lot of people their expectations are to receive it in a relatively quick amount of time but my guess is that people who are just starting out with drop shipping don't really consider these things they don't consider the shipping times being a reason for people wanting to cancel the order now all of a sudden you're receiving a ton of paypal chargebacks where they're just taking the money out of your funds because the customer claimed that they didn't receive the product i'm not trying to hate on people who do drop shipping and i'm not even trying to discourage you from trying drop shipping i think that you should try everything under the sun because that's always a good thing right try new things try different things to know what you're good at and you might be a perfect fit for it i'm not really sure i think what will help you decide on whether to start drop shipping or not is asking yourself about what you want and value in the long run for me i value learning how to start a business from the ground up and being involved in every single process all right that's enough ranting for me but that wraps it up those are four problems that i have with drop shipping i hope you guys can get some value from this if you're just considering it maybe you're just starting or in the middle of it i would love for you to drop a comment below and kind of share where you're at in your journey because anything can help you know it might help someone else we don't really know and that's pretty much it guys good luck out there

copy.ai is like the swiss army knife of copywriting once you understand what you want to do you can do a lot of things with it you can chop something up you can slice something you can i don't know what that was if you're not familiar with copy.ai and what it does what its features are i did make other videos where i talk about the best ways to use a tool like copy.ai this is kind of the next step this is for people who are running their own ecommerce store their own shopify store maybe selling a service so in this video i'm covering how you can scale your business using a tool like copy.ai and where you really need to be in your business journey so that you can get the full utility of a tool like this especially if you're in media buying or you're writing social media content or even at a sales role in real life i do think there are applications where you can sell a product in real life even better using a tool like this what i'm not going to cover are things like what is copy.ai what are the general features and benefits like what does the software do i'm not going to cover gpg3 these are all things that you can watch my other two videos and learn a little bit more about because they're pretty interesting so with that let's get started and let's dive right in the trick with copy.ai is to know exactly what your customers need answered or what they want to know before they even know it now this might sound confusing and don't worry i'm about to break it down if you think about it really copy.ai's job for you is to magnify and amplify the things that you know your customers like to hear and what's awesome is that if you've done the work to understand your customers really in depth and you know that they're looking for a specific feature that your product has or your service has then you are way ahead and this is a huge sign that this tool can really help you essentially you can use your customer knowledge about your product or service something that you know for a fact has worked selling your product and once you know that little string of information about your customer that golden line that seems to really get their ears and their eyes lit up when you say it this is where copy.ai really comes in to save the day and save you time because you can essentially use copy.ai to multiply this message and say it in hundreds of different ways if you take a step back and think about it a lot of things that we learn in business and in life in general are pretty much the same lessons over and over and over again but they're just told in different ways that's why so many personal development books pretty much arrive at the same conclusion but we still read them because different words and different combinations of words seem to hit our ears different some slap harder than the others some just don't really do it for us we're bored by maybe the jargon full jargon full is that a word jargon full explanations for me specifically i like simple explanations i don't like big words that's just me it's like kind of the same reason why certain phrases in culture get really played out for example if you say damn daniel damn daniel back at it again with a white van for some people it's like oh yeah that's funny that's like that was like a trend that was cool but for other people it might be like oh my god dude that was so cringe like please never say that ever again i think that kind of applies to the marketing world as well when you're copywriting they're just phrases and words that people will ignore or just have a bad association with so they just programmed their brain not to really respond to it let me share with you an example from my own life when i just started my first business without going too deep into what i was selling and the overall idea of my business the idea is like eco-friendly shoes where i would brand the footwear as like vegan leather shoes okay so like just go with me here all right so when i launched my business i knew i wanted to go to trade shows and festivals because i figured that's kind of where i do best in a sales situation and even though these trade shows were like very grueling and were pretty poor exchange of time and value there was one thing that i don't think i would have learned anywhere else these customers would come in and when i was first getting started i would just say things like hi welcome let me know if you have any questions and i would just kind of let them do their shopping very kind of passive right there then i started doing something different when people would come into the booth i would ask them a question i would say hey have you ever heard of vegan leather shoes so either they would say no i've never heard of that what is that or they would say yeah i actually am familiar with vegan leather shoes and i have some dress shoes that are vegan and what i discovered was that every time i said yeah what makes us different as a shoe company is that our vegan materials will last over 10 years without peeling or cracking that seemed to like get everyone's attention a lot of people would have a change in their entire body language like eyes light up they would take dude they would do double takes like oh what like people who weren't even in the conversation were like what like would you say like well i would hear all these different like responses and be like oh like i don't need to keep on pounding that these shoes are comfortable or that the design is nice or that the that we're having a sale because this string of information has done the best job at getting people's attention so like that was essentially my version of like discovering that that that beautiful line of words that just happened to resonate with my audience and the thing is that's going to be different for every single business because you guys have different audiences different products that's why i say you know a tool like copy.ai can't help you answer questions uh or really interact with your customers for you you kind of have to know what that golden line is that piece of information that's going to get people's attention is like you got to know what that is no personal anecdote there but now that you know what that was for me you can start to think about interactions that you've had with people where they seem genuinely interested think about the interactions you've had that wasn't family or friends because you know our family and friends they love us they're a little biased they're gonna seem interested maybe when they're not really interested and if you haven't experienced that then you need to change up your sales pitch and try to you know figure that part out and you will find it it's just a matter of variation it took me like six months and like seven different trade shows for me to find that so it's you know it definitely takes work to test what kind of lines work and what doesn't work so let's get back to the actual tool so once you actually have this piece of information you can use all of copy.ai's wonderful tools to essentially magnify it let's say you're running some facebook ads this is something that i've done as well but i've taken that line that i just shared with you and i have put it into copyright ai so it can pretty much multiply hundreds of different other similar types of copy so that i could use it and deploy it on my ads then i then you can kind of test to see which one is the most effective just based off like how many clicks and uh they're just general response of your facebook ads so quick disclaimer um if you are in the stage of building your business where you're still trying to get a product market fit i'm just gonna say it up front copy die ai might not be 100 worth it for you i do think that you can utilize it to maybe make the process um quicker in ways but ultimately once you do have proof of product market fit you can really go guns blazing with a tool like this now i want to kind of transition to talking about copy.ai and some of the upgrades that i've noticed in the past couple months you know i was a really early adopter in the software so i saw it when it was kind of like in its first version and there were definitely some flaws some clunky parts of the software but let me just talk about some quick pros and cons about the copy.ai right now on october 10th 2021. let's start with the advantages now first off the actual outputs the ai generated responses are like way better in my opinion they actually tend to be a lot more relevant and they don't have a lot of like gibberish like they used to no shade at you copy i just saying there were some really funny responses that i would get you know back in the day when you know they were still kind of working out some of the flaws but i can safely say after testing out some of the features and different tools that i definitely notice a huge difference a huge upgrade in the actual ai generated responses which is ultimately the goal right it just gives me more confidence as a user because you know before when you're using a product that is supposed to help you in copywriting and it has like some kind of grammatical error it kind of makes you lose confidence in the product so this is a sign not only that the products improving but the team behind it is really really they put a lot of care let's just put it that way definitely more relevant and less gibberish second of all there is a fresh new ui if you log in you can actually go through the tools everything's kind of broken down into projects now so if you have like a facebook ad you want to have a certain copy but you have like a tick tock ad you have a certain kind of copy then you can separate those and then choose accordingly which response you think would would fit better you could save before but it was kind of like all one big blob of like saved copy and sometimes you would forget oh did i want to use this copy for a blog or a facebook ad and the third advantage is that longer inputs like more detailed descriptions around your service and product are seemingly getting better results i remember back in the day like a few months ago copy.ai would be better when you put in short descriptions like vegan other shoes but now i can like write out a whole paragraph it seems about my product and its product features um and that we offer free shipping and returns and it will actually have more relevant outputs than it did before like that's just like really huge it's way more relevant to what you are selling so i'll say that is a huge improvement that i've noticed so very very excited to see how it continues to improve now the only disadvantage i would say is that the amount of tools on copy.ai can be a little daunting there's like a bunch of tools and even though they're segmented and categorized i do feel like they can at least add a short description when you do click on a tool and at least like give me a one or two sentence like brief on exactly what kind of outputs i can expect when using this tool even though most of them are like very very straightforward at face value you know what you're gonna get kind of it's not the case for every single tool just like something stupid obvious that like when i click on it there's a short description and i know that oh yeah like this is exactly what i'm looking for sort of thing because at this point you already have so many tools why not just go the extra step and like go more specific with what that tool is going to spit out for you and i think that would just save me a little time as a user personally and before i head out you are more than welcome to try copy.ai for yourself i'm going to include a little link down below there is a free trial and you should try it anyways and see if it really does help with your business that's what i would recommend with that i really appreciate you just stopping by and listening let me know if you have any questions or if you have any softwares you'd like me to review and with that i'll catch you guys in the next video peace

out of all the plugins that are used there's not that many plugins where I can confidently say that it makes me money and it's absolutely worth the price and this plug-in is called Luke's photo reviews and it projects maybe around 10 minutes to download and set up and you don't really have to do much work after that it works for you pretty much 24/7 for the longest time I didn't really feel like I needed to change anything because right out of the gate this theme provides you with a very clean looking customer review section it does cost money but in a moment I'm gonna show you why $9.99 a month is actually a bargain for something like this they do have a 14-day trial for you to kind of test it out I also included a link down below so you can go ahead and click on that link it'll bring you to this page right here and then from here you can go ahead and add this app to your Shopify store this is what you're gonna see once you actually download the plug-in I downloaded Luke's probably seven months ago and here you can see that Luke's has generated over $5000 in sales one of my favorite features about Luke's right off the bat is that it allows the customer to add a photo of your product and it just adds a little bit more I guess authenticity to reviews because nowadays it's really important to make the customer who's coming to your store if you like their actual customers who are talking about the products not just pre-written like fake reviews that pretty much mean nothing especially if you have a store that sells apparel we're sizing might be something different a customer might actually leave a really valuable review and it might help another customer choose the right size then you're saving a potential return or exchange in the future and you would be saving money you can actually make it so that when a customer leaves a four star review or under it won't show up on your website under the collect reviews tab we have this option to you Auto publish new reviews and here's where you can kind of set what kind of reviews you want to actually show on your website and which ones you want to leave out so here I have it set for four stars and above so every single review that comes in four stars five stars will automatically publish on my product page and customers can go ahead and read that now if it's a three star to start a one star it's not going to publish that immediately instead it's gonna funnel through my dashboard from your dashboard you can go ahead and improve that which will then publish it on your website so for example here we see Stephanie gee she bought this shoe over here she gave it a three stars and it didn't show up on my website you know obviously you don't want low star ratings to show up on your website maybe a couple of them just to show that you know you are being authentic you're not trying to hide anything what I do personally is I don't just leave them out of my website and they call it a day so you can go ahead and click on Stephanie's name right here and I open a new tab where you can actually email Stephanie this gives you an opportunity to make up for your mistake don't just leave them in the dark and then expect them to buy again when they had a terrible experience and no one followed up with them you know once someone has a bad experience they're out the door and then it's like you never see them again so you might be asking how do you incentivize customers to leave a review in the first place so who's actually going to spend the time and go to your website write a well-thought-out review and then snap a photo and then upload it to their computer that seems like a lot of work I'm gonna go over to the settings option so the way that Luc's helps your customers write reviews is that you can offer a discount if people take time and write a really good review and for me what I do is I offer them a percentage discount you can also offer a fixed amount but I offer them a 15% discount if they leave a review for a product that they purchased once you actually make a purchase there's obviously some time that needs to pass before they get the product you know especially with all the delays that are happening because of this pandemic what I've told links to do is 14 days after they purchased that product they're gonna receive an email inviting them to make a review and I chose 14 days because I want them to experience the product get a better understanding of what they like about the shoe and maybe what they don't like the shoe if I set this email timer to maybe five days they might be like why is this company emailing me to leave a review for a product I haven't even received yet if you're really trying to make the best impression you can actually go under display reviews and you can choose the color of your stars you know maybe you have a brand color maybe you know the psychology of colors and you know which colors are known to evoke different emotions but anyways I have mine set to like this yellowish gold color you can select the font you can select a modern or classic style you can kind of test that on your own here I'll show you what it looks like on my actual website we're gonna dive into one of the product pages that I have and here we can see that we have two reviews here one of which has a photo and it even has this little check mark that verifies that this was a paying customer this person actually purchased they left a review they left the photo this is kind of a side-by-side comparison of what a review would look like with the photo and without the photo everything that I showed you is kind of what I set up I don't really go through each and every session but you can because this app is very powerful and yeah there's just a bunch of other integrations like klaviyo the email marketing software after ship in case you use after ship to print postage labels and and manager turns just a bunch of different ones I'm not gonna go into all of them but you can kind of check them out here I don't touch it too much I would say the basic plan is where I would start if you're just starting your store or if you have if you have a hundred orders or less a month then I would just stick to the basic plan you definitely get a good idea of how the plugin works and you'll be able to see if it's worth it so here in the advanced plan you can see this bottom part it says full Aliexpress importer so if you are doing drop shipping for example this plugin is super popular if you're doing drop shipping you're not actually holding physical products and you're just getting commissioned for selling products for other companies in theory you can start a store today import 30 different reviews and they're technically authentic review it's gonna make your store look like it's been around it's been established for some time so that's gonna wrap up my tour of links if you're just starting your Shopify store or if you have an existing store already I would recommend this one it's honestly very reliable you can find a link to download the plug-in below and you can get started immediately so and with that I'll catch you guys in the next video

and the way I think about it is like what makes a good tasting cake is not the toppings or the cream or you know the cherries or the fruits that you put on top of it it's got to be like the actual base the foundation I'm wearing my Moroccan djellaba and we're gonna talk about nootropics brain supplements something that I've been pretty interested in the last year or two from a distance away something like a brain supplement can seem like something out of a movie something like a limitless we're Bradley Cooper takes a pill and then becomes a super genius in my experience has been way different and the thing is these these supplements can get pretty pricey so if you're interested in some of these things that I'll share my experience with you today the first nootropic that I tried was alpha brain which is kind of the more popular one out there Joe Rogan owns this company called on it and so you know it's gotten a lot of popularity their main product is like alpha brain which is a nootropic it's supposed to be a dietary supplement that helps your memory helps creativity helps boost focus and there's a lot of great ingredients in there that are really natural that are supposed to be proven to help cognitive function so I bought this about a couple years back and I I tried to take it you know just to see what it was like overall the short answer is it kind of works the price kind of upped my expectation a little bit understandably I wanted it to work because I paid a good amount for it what I will say is overall I didn't feel like there was a big change in like my focus or my memory it was kind of a placebo effect on me in that when I would take it I would anticipate me being able to focus more so I then was like working harder and focusing more to kind of like activate it in a way overall it's not the solution that you're probably expecting when you think of like a brain supplement so that was my experience with alpha brain it is kind of disappointing to hear but I will say the reason I don't want to cancel it is because at that point of my life I also did have the greatest habits you know for example right now I'm taking this brain supplement and it's called lion's mane right there there it is see it says creativity and focus or something like that Oh mental clarity and focus this is kind of like in my opinion the same Lane of product except this one was way cheaper is $23.99 and the thing is this I'm having a better experience with but I don't think it's because it's necessarily this brain supplement today my habits are way better I'm actually exercising now I have a way healthier diet than I had just six months ago to a year ago I'm also just taking care of my body more my habits are kind of formed around helping my brain perform at its best I don't think it's fair to say that the alpha brain didn't really work because I was also doing so many things wrong in my opinion like I was totally sedentary at that time I remember eating mainly like just carbs in like deep fried foods pretty much for the whole day for multiple days in a row I didn't have the habits that would encourage your good mental focus you know what I'm saying I'm actually totally open to buying it again and trying it now that I have all these great habits but overall you know these kind of brain supplements are kind of like the cherry on top you know it's not gonna be that switch that turns you into this machine and the way I think about it is like what makes a good tasting cake is not the toppings or the cream or you know the cherries or the fruits that you put on top of it it's got to be like the actual base the foundation if you're not really taking care of yourself you're not setting yourself up for success or ready with like good sleep and healthy food and exercise like that's a good foundation right and if you're not setting yourself up and that way then it's not like you know one little pill of like healthy foods or healthy ingredients is gonna really make a big difference because there's so much going against the grain already it's just like overwhelming the same time if you build all these great habits like right now I do cold showers every day it helps the skin helps my mind sharpen immediately then I eat a really healthy acai bowl you know I go for a run or I work out a little bit and then I taken this product when I know I'm gonna have a really like brain heavy day I'm gonna have to focus a lot then yeah I think that it's fair to say that it will kind of improve your performance just by a little bit it's just like that cherry on top we're here ever had a strawberry on a cake you know that's that tastes amazing you know what I'm saying the strawberry with the cake and the whipped cream all of it just kind of comes together to make this beautiful creamy dessert that tastes really good that's how I see these kind of brain supplements working into my day to day life I try these things because I am a junkie for freaking me out the best way to improve myself and the best way to you know treat my body really well you know at this point at this point of your life if you're not taking care of your body and setting up those habits it's gonna be increasingly hard to set up those habits when you're thirty thirty-five and forty you know and so that's what I'm trying to do now health is wealth in 2020 that's just what it is and that is pretty much my video today hope you guys enjoy my Jalapa you know it is pretty nifty if I do say so myself that's pretty much it folks and hopefully you guys stay healthy out there it's crazy times at this moment right now with the coronavirus and wish you guys all the best health and success and I'll see you guys next time

hey guys it's free and today I'm gonna show you how I designed this homepage on Shopify's most popular free theme Brooklyn back when I was learning how to do drop shipping I would always see Brooklyn being used and it looks really clean and super simple to use this homepage is really designed to tell a story and introduce product so if there's a way to make this free theme look incredible then that's what I'm gonna try to do so let's dive right into it one of the first things that I do when I get a home page is just delete all the sections because I want to start you know completely clean most people who use Brooklyn which is a lot of Shopify stores they're probably going to use the template that was there by default so if I want to look a little bit different then I should probably just create whatever I want that best tells my story here we have the home page here this page is looking pretty pretty buttery a better basics better price the thing with your heading guys is whenever you write copy especially that's when it's gonna be the first thing people see you need to introduce the product and you need to be clear about what you're selling if not then people aren't gonna understand immediately and they have a way higher chance of bouncing but that's pretty much it it's very clean I only have one I don't like doing the whole auto-rotate I think it's distracting the next section is rich text it's just an area for you to include some copy here is where I want to start speaking to that customer I'm trying to reel them in for people this doesn't speak to you that's fine I don't expect this copy to speak to most people and we started Sundays to Mondays as a tribute for one particular type of man that friend who wears a basic t-shirt every day in the same color for various reasons that's us and we come in all shapes and sizes we're tall and lanky short and broad with white horses and slim waists that sounds kind of weird now reading it that's kind of the idea is like Akili States examples the people and it can like kind of relate to you maybe some insecurities that people might have here are the bestsellers options I mean all I did was add a collection to it right around here if you get people to read this and then continue scrolling they're gonna be probably interested in what you sell already at least that's how I my brain thinks it's really good to show them your heaviest hitters if there's something that you know sells well and catches the eye put it here because it'll speak lengths but this is just saying you know your here's what here's what we're selling the next part is a slideshow we do have these testimonials here and I just found these stock images on unsplash I believe or maybe I even found them on canva it's pretty much just like a little review that I wrote for myself and my idea is I would click on this it doesn't lead to anything now but I could click on this and see what kevin l bought and then see his his fit if you go to the next page you can see another version of this this guy happens to be five five short and broad so as you can see I'm trying to appeal to different body types here and I think that's valuable the next section after the testimonial is who is this design for it's another rich text section again this is to really rope in my reader pretty much if you're if you have the same habits as we do then this is what what kind of thoughts we have for us there's nothing better than wearing a crisp new basic tea we avoid daily decision fatigue and stress with a basic approach to fashion I mean I'm not saying it's the best thing in the world but it's like when you're meeting a friend and you're just starting to get to know each other because you don't know each other very well and you just try to continue to find some common ground between you guys so that you guys can talk about it and there doesn't have to be this awkward silence except how that translates into like website building is instead of just there being awkward silence they're just gonna leave and never give you another chance ever that's not true but you just have to win their attention back you know over time we're gonna see how much based on how much time people spend on your homepage and perhaps what they click on what they're most interested in and then you can change your homepage from here I change my homepage quite a bit just to kind of keep it new keep it fresh especially for people coming back to the website the next one will be another call to action I haven't put it out yet because you know I don't have an actual product collection so I have to create like a fake one I think this is nice because if you have a store where it's really enticing to shop as like a whole and not just as one product then this is this is a good place to put it so after this shop t-shirt bundles our last little section is just an email newsletter sign up promise something that and that you can deliver on usually discounts and new really new product releases are a good place to start there's a few things left that I had to do on this homepage obviously like powered by Shopify it's nice to take that out it's nice to add a footer with quick links to all the most important pages on your website as well as your social media so there's a couple things that I haven't exactly done yet for the most part this is a good blueprint for what a solid homepage could look like the purpose of each section is to to balance the ask and the storytelling by telling them a little bit about yourself and then showing them what they can sell but not in kind of like a salesy way here's my section if you want to copy it and for my colors real quick here's my background here is the hex code east 6e for DB if you want to copy it go for it play around in that section too don't be afraid because there's a lot of cool colors here's kind of my setup I did my brand killer 4 buttons links and accents and co tags some typography I'm using future a semi bold I just think it looks really clean I use century gothic for accent task text and body text here as you can see you know easy to read is all I care about that's pretty much it guys I think this is a really strong home page and if you have a different idea of what makes a good home page or if you even think a home page is important let me know below because I'm the curious to know what you guys think there's a million ways to do a website so really you just need to kind of get in there and do something that you know would look clean professional and that tells the story anyways if you're watching this because you have a store or you're about to start an online store check out Spotify or check out Shopify because I think you can agree that what I'm showing you is pretty user friendly you don't have to know how to code to make an incredible website and there's a lot of different website builders out there like Squarespace and WordPress but if you watch my other video about me reviewing all of them you'll know that Shopify in my opinion has been the easiest to work with on every single angle I think it's particularly good for physical products I'm not gonna lie with the service you're gonna have to probably sell whoever is giving that service so if it's you then make the homepage more personalized to the teachers the instructors and how that experience is gonna go because I feel like with services most of the selling point is just being able to start a good healthy relationship one that's mutually beneficial anyways let me know what you think of this homepage and maybe let me know what you think I should do with this homepage once it's finished should I give it away should I sell it I don't really know so let me know guys and with that I'll catch you guys in the next video see ya

how to custom design your shopify website that's what we're talking about today when it comes to customizing your website design shopify is pretty limited so how do you go about fixing the solution and what can you do to actually customize your website in a way where you believe it will generate more sales and grow your business and this is where i found shogun it's one of the most legit plugins that i've ever come across first of all it's incredibly user friendly it's a lot of drag and drop stuff but it also comes with a ton of different templates that allow you to custom design your product pages your home page any landing page that you want and blogs but with any page builder i found that it's really difficult to optimize your mobile view and then your desktop view it ends up being this game where you just have to like adjust the padding and the margins and then the photo how that photo is viewed until you just get like a somewhat okay view of your photo on both desktop and mobile while shogun has a way to edit your mobile view separately from your desktop view so in this video i'm going to share with you how to customize your shopify website and to do it without sacrificing your website speed to do it in a user-friendly way where you don't need to know how to code and in my opinion in a very affordable way i'm also going to show you how i built my new home page and why it is so much more superior than my old home page let's dive into the computer and we'll take a look at my new homepage this is the shogun app right here here we have a bunch of great reviews but this is the logo so you know and yeah right now it's 39 a month which probably the price of a good membership at a gym but first of all gyms are closed and second of all the price for a great home page is probably worth it it's not like a cheap plug-in but the benefits of this app is irreplaceable there's no other app like shogun that i found that is able to customize your shopify pages the way that this does so to download this you can click on the description below to download it for your own shopify store and check it out you can use this on any theme so once you download that to your shopify store you're going to end up on this dashboard area and here you can see i've created a bunch of different product pages already let's add a page and check out some of the templates here we have a bunch of cool templates uh you also have the option to create a blank new page if you have a wireframe or a vision of how your website is going to look like in the future but they have some great templates here and these are just some of the landing pages and the homepages here's a couple templates for the blogs this is the template that i used to create my home page and just to walk you through a little bit of the ui for the most part if you've designed your website or if you know how to drag and drop then you're going to know how to use shogun first of all one of my favorite things is structural blocks and they're kind of like templates but for like sections and it's literally a drag and drop so if i want to include something like this value prop large i can just drag it in and replace the images and the copy so that it fits with my website and this is actually the page that i used for my redesign which is right here so that's the first reason i love shogun you get a lot of these different templates and you can use them for a various number of reasons the second reason has to do with the mobile versus the desktop which is honestly it's game changing and for that i'm going to switch over to my finished home page that i just made earlier today let's just take this hero section for example this text was very small on this home page so one of the things that i did was that i wanted to make sure that the text was big enough for the mobile but i also wanted to make sure that it wasn't super small on this home page so one thing that you do is you can double click and then under the controls tab you got two different tabs here but under the controls tab you just click on this little icon right here and then you can click whether you're editing on desktop laptop tablet or phone and when you make a change like if i wanted to make the phone much smaller let's say 10 i don't know why i'd want that but if i go back to the home screen you see that it wasn't affected you can do that for images too so if you need to um change the way that an image looks or how long it is on a mobile screen versus your desktop you can do that and that's what i did here because you can see that with this photo i made it much more long right here to take the whole screen and this is so huge because like i said it's so hard to format properly with shopify's plugins they don't make it very user friendly for optimizing a mobile first web design practice like most of my website visitors i believe 80 percent come from mobile and the fact that most website builders don't allow you to do something like this is crazy to me because it seems like almost a basic feature that you would have i also love the ability to create sections and columns the way that i did this was that i created this column right here where i just dragged a column over here and then i changed the number to three columns and then i would include an image right into the middle of this column right here and then i added a little text that's pretty much how i did it and then i just went to my illustrator and designed these very simple numbers that i then exported as images and it worked very very nicely as uh as a little features section so without going into all of the features of shogun i kind of showed you the main reasons why i love using this and as you can tell on top of it it's super easy to use it's very user friendly you could recreate a custom website on shopify within a day if you know what you're doing this this homepage took me about three hours and that's because i didn't know what i was doing i didn't have a wireframe which means i didn't know what copy i would use or what images i would use or even how the homepage would be structured i was just kind of freestyling and this is what i came up with but if you actually take the time to write it out and then design it i think it's going to be way faster for you so now let me show you the finished product now we have a hero that clearly states made for the planet and animals so that is kind of the unique value prop because it tells you a little bit about my brand scope and the values that i have for my business and this time we have two different call to actions for returning customers next we go into this little area immediately you hit them with the social proof which is great because you want to have this idea where you're like oh like this is worth checking out i should continue scrolling on this website then we go into why tastemaker this is where we dive into the actual benefits which are completely different than features the benefits are how the product makes you feel why they should choose your product and features are more like what materials you use why it's comfortable or why it's durable but benefits are more on a psychological and emotional level which is why i want to hit them with this first they start to nod their heads and they start to think yeah that is what i'm looking for that is what i want in my fashion choice so the next part is the benefits which is kind of confusing because i just made a distinction about features and benefits at this point i'm selling the vision and then at this point i'm selling the products after that they're ready to check it out and i don't want them to need to wait any longer so they can go ahead and start shopping by clicking one of these i just have to add the link they're not clickable right now so this is the full website so this would be like the mobile view here we can see it's very clean and then they have this section of psychological benefits down to the features down to the call to actions and that's pretty much it if you want to start using shogun you can click the link down in the description below and you can start custom designing your own shopify store today also comment down below if you have any questions around shogun or if you want to see more in-depth content on how i created this specific homepage last but not least i gotta ask for you to hit that like button if you enjoyed this content it would mean the world to me and i'm lowkey trying to get a hundred subscribers soon so that would be pretty awesome to hit it i hope you guys enjoyed this video and have a wonderful rest of your day peace out

i was placed in special ed when i was in the third grade what does that have to do with this video well to this day i find that writing really takes a lot of energy from me and luckily i've gotten better you know just through like high school and college today i want to talk about copy.ai and how it can improve your overall content creation and for the last three years i been running an e-commerce brand that i started pretty much right out of college where i sell private label footwear online and as a one-person team i've had to wear a lot of different hats in digital marketing and content creation and social media that have kind of given me a good understanding of the entire process this is a follow-up video to my last copy.ai video where i just gave my first impressions and did a little test comparing my copywriting skills and in ai copywriting i'll link that video down in the description if you guys want to watch that but today i want to talk about how copy.ai is literally changing the game for content how many tools that they're releasing all the time and how much more efficient you can work because of these new tools now first i want to explain copy.ai for people who don't know it so let's say you're trying to use copy.ai to create a hook for your blog you can just type a little blurb about your company the topic the industry what it's about and it'll give you different types of hooks that you can use from there but when you look at the results you might not actually see a full complete hook that you are 100 satisfied with instead you'll see different ways of thinking maybe you'll start off the hook with relatability maybe you started off with a fact and from there it's your job to use your knowledge of your customer base and your audience to kind of optimize those different hooks the best way to use copy.ai is actually the same way you would use an instagram filter you know you upload the photo you choose the filter and then you tweak it to your liking and then you post it so from this example you can tell that copy.ai mainly saves you time in the ideation phase of creating content for me when i'm blogging creating social media content creating ad copy for my facebook ads a lot of the time goes into ideation figuring out what the hook is different ideas that i can use to capture people's attention there's just a lot of things that go under the tent of ideation copied iai is great for that aspect of it but you know as you move towards the middle and end parts of that you know it's not going to help you execute for sure and it's not going to help you identify your customer needs for you although it can give you ideas there's a tool for it so now i want to share with you six different practical use cases that copy.ai has helped me with in the last couple months and might be able to help you with in the future the first one is blogs we kind of talked about this one but it does have a tool where you can come up with a hook for your blog as well as ideas for your blog i don't know if you can relate but as a one-person team a lot of the times i feel like i just wish i had a different variety of thought so sometimes i run into idea fatigue where i'm not even sure if my idea is good so i wish i can welcome a different school of thought if you will and because copy.ai can give you new outputs every time you click make copy it's just a matter of time before you kind of train your eyes and find a good idea eventually so the second thing is running ads i run a lot of facebook ads and have in the past i've probably spent over forty thousand dollars just on my business ad account in the past couple of years and really part of what i've learned makes a great ad is a great combination of ad creative ad copywriting and interest targeting now the interest targeting is more technical if you don't know about facebook ads you can kind of ignore that but when it comes to copywriting and coming up with the right creative the right video how you're gonna grab someone's attention within the first two to three seconds then you need some ideas you need some good ideas a lot of the time i'm just testing and experimenting with like five different types of captions or copywriting uh sometimes it's hard to come up with those five and that's where i would use copy.ai to kind of give me some ideas especially with copywriting i feel like we have our own biases on like what makes a good hook why someone would keep on reading i like to use copy.ai as kind of like a neutral third party because i know that i'm not just like in my own head about it so i know what to look out for but sometimes i just am missing that like that variety so the third one is social media management they have a great tool uh for instagram and facebook captions but mainly for instagram if you think about the amount of time that you spend coming up with instagram captions it's pretty insane considering instagram in 2021 is it's kind of going down in organic reach especially compared to like previous years you probably don't want to spend a ton of time just like nitpicking every single letter and word and punctuation you might as well you let copy.ai create 10 different captions for you and then you can kind of like i said take it and edit it the way you want based on your knowledge of the customer if you have the creative for seven days worth of instagram content you can create the captions in literally probably 30 minutes or less number four is identifying pain points they have this tool where you can literally come up with different pain points your customers might experience and it's really helpful in the beginning stages of a business when you're still kind of figuring out who your target audience is i know i've experienced that same thing where i'm just like who is my target audience i mean i have a general idea but when it comes to you know trying to relate to why they buy what kind of solutions i'm solving for them it's not super clear in the beginning so this can help you kind of put yourself in the customer's shoes but if you understand your customers pain points you can create different products that address their pain points you can write blogs create content that are more relatable and overall it's just kind of like the foundation for you as a as a business to keep on growing number five is new business names these are pretty useful when you're just getting started with a project or a business that you've always wanted to start i'm not great at coming up with names personally i feel like they're just too like verbose too long not very snappy you can put in a blog about peanut butter and it will come out with different names for that blog and you can choose from there number six is website copy optimization i know for me i'm always testing out different types of hero copy and i know that updating this copy will help new customers learn about me in a quicker way in a clearer way and if you're not communicating why they should stay what's different about you what you're selling what the benefits and the features are about your product then they're gonna leave really quick so yeah they have a tool for different types of hero text that you can use for your website they have product descriptions tools where they can spawn different product descriptions they also have a tool for meta descriptions if you want to boost your seo although it's your job to kind of go in depth and research the different keywords that you want to optimize for so those are six different use cases for copy.ai and like i kind of mentioned in the first video this is a tool for people who are freelancers who are youtubers who are small business owners who have employees that they want to give this tool to so they can work more efficiently it's a good tool so i would definitely check it out and at the very least try out their seven day free trial i'll leave a link in the description below and you can give that a try for yourself so those are some useful use cases but now i want to talk about the future of cpg3 which is the ai that powers softwares like copy.ai if you didn't know it was created by a company called openai which is founded by a few different co-founders one of which is elon musk so elon musk is helping you write and read better i'm not mad about it if you go to openai's website you can see different types of uses that cpt-3 is is used for and one of them is literally creating an article where only 52 of the people were able to tell if this was an article written by a human or a robot that's how close that's how advanced this language model is imagine if copy.ai came out with an option to create full on medium-sized articles 500 words a thousand words and you can essentially type in any topic like the history of genghis khan i don't know and it would come out with a thousand word essay on genius con i mean to me the first thing i think about is damn first of all students would be flocking to your software because they would be waiting till last night before an essay is due and they would just put in their their topic and then like kind of tweak it up but yeah just imagine that for your own business imagine just being able to create blogs within literally 30 seconds to a minute and then just using your knowledge your expertise of your customers and your industry to make that even better that would be crazy and i think that would ramp up the amount of blog output in the world by so much that the people who know about copy.ai are going to have a huge huge lead on pretty much everyone else i think it has a lot of room to help us as digital marketers as business people content creators it's very exciting so with that guys i hope you enjoyed this video i hope you got some value out of it if you did please like and subscribe down below we're trying to hit a thousand subscribers by the end of 2021 make sure to use the link down below if you want to start that seven day free trial and with that guys i'll catch you guys in another video peace

the main takeaway with this is a lot of people are choosing the wrong niches to put it simply I think there's a lot of traps when it comes to finding a niche it's deceptively challenging right because even using Advanced SEO tools like HRS it can be deceiving how easy it is to rank for a certain keyword if you don't have experience starting one of these directories in these so-called easy niches and failing and then realizing oh shoot like there's a ton of competition or the competition that's there has Incredible backlinks or whatever it is you won't know that's why I really want to talk more about the validation of a directory Niche um so that you can do the proper preparation before spending the next month or two on a project like this so today I'm going to give you three different niches that you can build website directories out of but there is a little bit of a Twist so out of the three there's one that's a good Niche that is Evergreen you can monetize through display ads there's one that looks beautiful but it's a trap and um I will go into why it's a trap and it's very difficult to make a successful directory out of this Niche and the third Niche is for my more advanced directory builders for people who maybe have a little bit more experience with directories and want to go for something that can earn 5 to 10K uh a month um if you can rank number one on Google that is this third Niche monetizes differently it's not through display ads it's more through selling featured listings and there's a little bit more salesmanship involved but with that said the ceiling for Revenue every month can be way higher basically 10,000 monthly visitors on this third Niche website versus on the first Niche website is like exponentially more valuable I did get a lot of questions about how to find a niche and I can show you a quick method using h which I like to do but to be fair all the niches that I found were a combination of complete Randomness typing in keywords into HRS something catching my eye when I'm just scrolling on Tik Tok kind of taking a notice that everything almost everything in this world has some kind of Interest the next time your friend for example is looking to go somewhere or visit somewhere whether it's for entertainment or something um that is needed which is really vague and I get that but keep your eyes pered uh sorry keep your ears perked so the first Niche is dog park near me or dog parks near me so check this out if we type in dog pars we will see a pretty significant amount of volume here we're seeing 35,000 monthly searches that's a pretty good amount of volume now I want to show you something interesting which is if we just remove the S we go to dog park bam so dog park near me gets 73,000 monthly searches isn't that kind of wild you get a wildly different number if you just remove one letter as we can see here from the keyword difficulty they're all under 20 which is what I look for whenever you start a website directory I recommend choosing a kind of Target keyword this is the keyword that you're essentially optimizing your whole entire website around and you know it should influence a lot of decisions along the way like your domain name ideally you should choose one with dog park near me or dog park dog park is really good here you know it gets 23,000 um 23,000 monthly searches we call that an exact match domain you're also going to use it in your website slug headers image alt texts meta descriptions all of that stuff should basically contain this target keyword let's go into seeing why I think this is a pretty good Niche so if we click into dog park I'm just going to check some things so here we see that majority traffic is from the US and there's some that are from Australia and United Kingdom which are still tier one countries to get traffic from you're going to get paid the most if you go the display adout we're going to scroll down here these are the top top 10 ranking websites so it's interesting cuz the keyword is dog park near me keep in mind this is not a nationwide top 10 probably just like some top 10 for a specific City or or region but it's still useful I just want to be able to see if there's any compet competition right looking at nyab bone so this is interesting right let's just type in 9001 which is like a general LA dog park this is really cool this is a directory and um it looks like a pretty simple one at that I already see ways that you can improve upon this it's a very very simple one but check this out this page gets almost 20,000 monthly visitors that's pretty insane it's so simple if I were going to a dog park I mean I'd kind of want to know know more information is there like a fountain like is there water are there you know little poopy bags for my dog I'd like to see an image of the the current state the grass you know of the park when you see a competitor you you you always want to ask yourself is it realistic that I could build something better and the reason why I say I could also improve on this is because looking at some of these other keywords we can see that yes dog park near me the most searched term but look at the other ones indoor dog park offleash dog park dog water park small dog park there's obviously a lot of interest in specific dog parks like people don't want to just go to any dog park they're not satisfied with that if I were to improve upon this directory or if I were to create my own dog park directory include all of those like include all those features whether or not it is an off leash dog park you should mention it you can say not an offleash dog park is a offleash dog park naturally when you do this for every City you're going to start ranking for these keywords anyways that's just the first competition I'm already seeing but you know let's look into it a little bit more actually here we see there's 72 backlinks and 57 referring domains if you're not familiar with backlinks it's more of a quality over quantity game right if you get a backlink from Forbes it's easily worth more than you know a th000 backlinks from crappy little websites what I like to do is check out best links only and it looks like these guys have uh 10 solid back links out of their 78 or whatever these are Okay the reason I say that is only one of their backlinks are actually delivering traffic to the directory itself which is right here this backlink here is resulting in 23 visitors that are coming to Nylabone docomo not have any traffic they're simply backlinks from um seemingly High Authority websites which could be good but you know it kind of makes me think that maybe they bought them or that they're just like not really super super strong backlinks a really strong sign of a really good backlink is one where it actually has traffic flowing to your website that's huge in what I've seen in my personal experience I'm kind of curious to see the website as a whole so I'm going to delete that and just check this out they have almost 600 pages and they have all sorts of random dog related content they're ranking for do dog smile which I think they do uh top 10 small dog breeds top 10 police dog breeds 600 pages is a lot but I think this isn't a big concern I've noticed that Google will really reward topical relevance so what I mean by that is let's say you have a 50-page website it has all 50 states and in every single one of those pages like you know Alabama Arkansas California whatever you list all the dog parks but because all the 50 pages which is like 100% of your website is only talking about dog parks uh Google will be able to see like oh wow like yeah they have less pages but it's hyp specific they must be kind of an expert at this at least that's what I believe and I I've seen my own websites outrank other websites with literally 10x 100x index Pages just because my entire website's so narrowed in on essentially one single keyword okay so that was just one competitor right so what is this here let's check out this offleash dog parks for rent oh wow okay so this is another directory this is rank two I guess you could rent these spots for dog parks which is really interesting so this directory uh gets 6,800 views a month this one's kind of weird because this the fact that this is ranking number two for dog park near me it it gives me confidence and I'll explain why a lot of website Direct and keyword research is understanding people's intent behind what they type so like what are people actually trying to look for when they type in dog park near me into Google my intuition says that people don't really want to spend money renting dog parks this is giving me mixed signals that Google's ranking this website because perhaps there's not enough other good you know directories or or just websites in general that are able to point people people to what they want which is dog parks it's either that or it means that people who are typing dog park near me want to rent a dog park which I just like I mean logically that just doesn't really make sense to me so from an SEO perspective this gives me some confidence because I'm thinking maybe the reason why these guys are on the second page is because there is an opportunity for someone to just create a better dog park directory let me see what the whole website as a whole is getting a lot of back links here $759,000 backlinks but you're saying that only 337 are good yeah I mean these are really good backlinks though let's see what other keywords they're ranking for dog names 84,000 monthly surges wow they're obviously dog related but again I may still go ahead with this if I have a whole website just about dog parks it could have a chance it could definitely have a chance so looking at the top two competitors through HFS I would probably say yes I could build something better two I'm not super concerned with the competition so it passes those now let's move on to the second Niche which in my opinion is a trap it's a great example of why even with all these Cool Tools like H refs a keyword that looks easy is actually quite difficult to rank four so this keyword is beaches near me actually I'll just type in beaches I know right here it says 37 is the keyword difficulty but I swear I checked just a couple days ago and it said it was like a keyword difficulty of three so I was like what that's that's so low with all that said it's not terribly high right I think it accurately represents the difficulty like if you're just getting started don't choose anything above a 20 okay but look 3.4 million monthly searches where there's keywords that contain the word beaches if you can just get a little slice of that pie a little slice we're talking 50,000 monthly searches or 100,000 you know that could very well be a you know3 34 $5,000 a month website let's try to understand more right 37 is actually not enough to deter me at least someone like me who has built directories but let's do a little bit more digging so if we click into this we also see hey there's Yelp there's Trip Advisor Yelp again this is the first rank that's getting um 6.8k monthly uh visitors it's cool look it's a directory here if you notice here it's giving us the top 10 for Tampa or like Florida I guess not representative of beaches near me from a country standpoint obviously I'm just also going to look up beaches near me in Google and I'm going to look for different websites so this is what I found I think the other day the first ranking website let's check it out this is a directory right here I do this because with atfs anything that's a near me keyword you want to verify by typing into Google beaches near Seattle beaches near New York beaches near California that kind of stuff this would be your compet like if you were to create a nationwide directory for beaches near me you probably wouldn't even be able to ever outrank this on California maybe you could get to the front page let me see or I guess we should check here so we have Yelp we have the County of LA california.com TR adviser um you know it's probably possible to get to the front page but this is your competition in general you want to try and choose a niche where you can basically be one of the only competitors this is only California specific and it's getting 42,000 monthly visitors lots of backlinks here I'm assuming plenty of pages too so 2,300 index Pages all about beaches um and they also rank for 48,000 keywords lot of damn there's a lot of newe beach interest over here man that's kind of crazy overall it's like okay this is pretty difficult and there's a section down in HRS where it shows you other competitors so here we have sandy.com let's check out what this is would you look at that another Beach directory to compete with and this one looks like it's worldwide actually but let's just take a look at this okay this one gets 27,000 monthly visitors 1.5k backlinks um we're just going to go through the motions here 38 these are good back links why HED right here that's a good one a lot of beaches are really well known they're really famous so they might have their own website or the city might have its own website so that's your competition as well so overall you know I think that the keyword difficulty is okay not insane but it's mainly the number of players in the space from a quick look there are niches out there that exist where there's not a whole lot of competition there's not a whole lot of directories and they still get get plenty of search volume tens of thousands of monthly searches so the great thing is you don't have to choose niches like this where you're going to have a hard time competing in a lot of different states um sure you can go maybe hyper local but you're still by the nature of it it's going to be a little bit more challenging if it's your first time and if you're not well versed in SEO and how to get good backlinks so overall not worth it wouldn't recommend this third Niche is for the big hitters all right I'm talking to you if you want to go big if you're trying to get that 5K a month 10K a month uh directory website this is this is the kind of stuff you want to look for so this third Niche is stump grinder rental all right stump grinder rental uh I'm from California and I I don't know anything about stump grinding I don't think I've seen a stump grinder or or actually I yeah hly I don't even know look just look at this guys 22,000 monthly searches zero KD almost across the board longtail keyword skid steer stump grinder I don't know what that is but someone's interested in it actually 400 people are interested in it on a monthly basis compact stump grinder rental we have walk behind stump grinder rental threo stump grinder rental when you see longtail interest in something like a rental that's expensive these are the types of things where you're starting to think okay if I'm going to make a website directory out of this the type of customer that's going to come to my website is going to be way more valuable than someone you know looking for a dog park or looking for a beach because you can take that visitor and if they're looking to spend money on a stump grinder rental let's just check here uh top 10 Home Depot it looks this looks like a very simple stump grinder this is $176 a day I would assume that there's other ones that are more expensive like this one this is $420 a day it looks like really heavy duty stump grinding you can see how valuable one lead can be to Arts Rental in this case or any kind of local stump grinder rental business when you see that it still has 22,000 monthly surges and it's really low competition to rank for and people are spending a lot of money uh renting these these machines the wheels start to turn and I start thinking okay you build out the directory you do it nationwide and then you basically try to either sell featured listings basically giving these local rental businesses more visibility and you can get Mr that way or you can do what like a care.com does which is just sell the lead requires a little more salesmanship but you basically call these local companies and say hey I have this directory website getting $5 10,000 monthly visitors I think we can definitely get you more leads would you be interested in getting a featured post or something like that whatever it is right like it's going to require more salesmanship is what I'm saying but the potential for revenue on a website directory like this is so much higher uh it's essentially a B2B rather than a b Toc directory is one way you can think about it I love this one it's so boring you have Home Depot Sun Bel rentals United Rentals which I know is a really big rental company a I don't I don't fear big companies dominating the the top 10 um in this case especially because again I think it I I do believe in having extremely laser targeted topical relevance I genuinely think there's a chance to rank on the first page for a lot of different cities maybe it's not necessarily Los Angeles California or whatever or like a really big city but I think a lot of cities uh without any kind of backlinks the second point is what I like to do when I valid valate a niche is I'll just type it in on Google and just say stump grinder rental Reddit you can see I already did this and so I was reading these different forums right and check this forum out and I was just reading there's one comment here it is 5 years ago but it does say don't go through lows or Home Depot overpriced I'm sure you can find a tool rental business in your area much cheaper and this person said hey thanks for the heads up I did do that and it was indeed cheaper these kind of comments it would be nice to see a more recent comment 5 years ago is kind of a long time but the point is this is a this is social listening this is a user signal that people are shopping around just because Home Depot offers stump grinder rentals it doesn't mean it fits everyone's specifications right we saw all those different keywords like the skid steer stump um the compact grinder there's there's so many stump R stump grinder rle STP grinder R there's so so many of these longtail keywords basically and then like since we're going to monetize this in a completely different way it is helpful to check the cost per click because it kind of gives us an idea of how much these local businesses might be paying per click try to choose one keyword make all your decisions and build the whole website around that keyword those are the three different niches I hope this was kind of helpful guys this is the most fun part of the website directory yes to this ch challenging but it's kind of like spotting treasure and that's why a lot of people are protective about sharing their domain name and their websites because once you find something that works you don't want to invite competition you work so hard just to find the name let alone go out and build it and then do the SEO work to get people to come visit and then monetize it last thing last thing I know this is a lot last last last thing I I I want to show you a really really quick way to find more of these examples this is one way you can start finding these different types of niches so all you do is go to the keywords Explorer here and you just type in near me as you can tell a lot of the keywords that we went over today actually all of them had near me like keyword near me and so if you just simply type that in you will get a list of the top most searched near me keywords what you can do here is just filter it by keyword difficulty I only want to see a maximum of you know what I want to see a maximum of a keyword difficulty 10 if you want to get real ambitious car wash near me is not bad right it's not branded most branded terms like Chipotle near me um Walmart near me it's not worth it because they probably have all sorts of tools on their website to point people to the Chipotles and Walmarts near them I'm hesitant to say to avoid branded keywords because my uh my directory the one that does like, 1500 2K a month is a branded keyword and the reason it works is because the company that I made a directory for they do have like a small locator on their website but it's absolutely trash like it does not work it's not updated the information is wrong that's why my my website gets so much traffic it should be a much smaller branded keyword maybe something that gets like 20,000 monthly s is 40,000 20 to 40 maybe 20 to 50,000 monthly searches don't choose any of these big ones I digress but basically to find like interesting near me Evergreen location based directory ideas just go to like the later pages right here we're seeing the 50 the sub 50k a month search uh keywords and this is where things get interesting basically you can just go through this list and then follow that same process that I showed you look up the competition check check out the top 10 ask yourself if you can make something better you know look at the back links look it up on Reddit these are all ways to validate your Niche basically do this if you want to compile a bunch of ideas and then do the due diligence to actually verify if it's worthwhile so that is how you find a niche and more importantly how you validate a niche and tell what's worth it and what's not um hopefully this was valuable hopefully this was informational genuinely never thought anyone would be interested in website directories and I've been wanting to make this content because I think about it every single day so I really appreciate it you know I do post on X or Twitter uh quite a lot I also started a little email newsletter for just shipping directories so sign up for that down below ask your questions away in the comments and yeah hopefully you guys have a great holidays and I will see you guys in the future see you thanks

hey guys it's prey and today I wanted to show you real quick how to do a really quick background remover or if you're trying to take a photo and make the background white I know a really quick way to do it that doesn't require going into Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop you can simply go to canva.com and this is honestly where I do a lot of my designs now because it's just so easy this is really good for Facebook ads or product pages if you're trying to you know take a photo and then remove the background so it looks really clean on a website today I'm actually making a Facebook ad I mean this has saved me hours of time before so I figure it could probably help you the way to do this is I go to canva.com this is honestly where I do a lot of my designs whether it be like a social media promotion for like Father's Day or buff up my email marketing to add more visuals if I'm starting a new store then I use it to make logos and you just have to sign up for an account which I believe is free and then you just go to create designs on the top right the design I'm making is a thousand by a thousand here we have a blank page I'm not gonna go into all of these because there's honestly a lot to unpack but I just want to go to my uploads and I already uploaded my photos here so I'm just gonna click on them here we have this regular photo of a shoe that I'm selling and it's just lying on my table here I want it to be completely clean and I just wanted to have the outline of the shoe the rest I want it to be white so I simply make sure to click on this photo go up to you effects and then background remover go ahead and click on that and then now you see it's loading up you see a bunch of other cool like designs here and bam just like that is super simple the whole thing is white and from here I usually just kind of crop it and make it a little bit smaller and then press Enter and there you go there's my crop and you can blow it up from here move it wherever you want and I'm gonna do that same thing with another photo that's very similar and this is actually a different shoe it's a used shoe I've worn this shoe for about a year year and a half so my facebook ad is kind of it's gonna be a photo of a new shoe and an old shoe and it's just gonna say brand new and one year or a year and a half just to show people who are scrolling through Instagram like hey look like here's how durable these shoes are and then I can kind of catch their attention that way so I'm gonna do the same process here and I'm gonna click on this go to effects background remover I'm just gonna wait for it it's pretty quick cool so again that was very fast I was probably like 10 seconds gonna crop of that and now I'm gonna blow this up like so now I can add some text real quick because I still need to add some stuff to the ad and here we have a bunch of templates here maybe like this like the design proposal part but you can take all these little parts and just delete them real quick like these little sections and then you can just edit the the main text brand-new and then put this in the middle and I'm just gonna ctrl copy it one and a half years old this is a one and a half year old shoe as you can see there's some scuffs on it already but it's okay like I think if it looked too good then it would be kind of suspicious now I just took these photos with my iPhone 10 so they're pretty crisp I don't have too much lighting equipment either so I just put it next to a window so I'm not sure if this remove background feature is available on the free option if not then I would honestly say it's worth it to go upgrade to the pro plan which is $9.95 a month that's the plan that I'm on it includes a lot more than just the background mover like I said I don't know if it's included I did it more for the elements because if you type in like anything that you want let's say like hat then you have all these different element once you're finished with your ad real quick you can just go up here press download and then it will create a high quality PNG for you so that you can go ahead and upload it to your what you might call it your Facebook ads so if you haven't already please consider subscribing liking or even commenting on my videos this is the number one way to motivate me to make more videos like this so yeah

how good is strategy BT in its form today at helping us solve some of our biggest problems as humans they say that health wealth and relationships are three main areas where humans will always have problems and that's why as someone who has a bunch of entrepreneurial ideas and thoughts and Inspirations that I write on my wall I'm always interested to see where I can solve problems in those areas if you're here for the first time I am like you I am curious about AI software and the potential for it changing our lives in the near future I made a video about copy.ai a little over a year ago if you want to check out that video it's pretty cool I run a test between AI copy and my own copy and then run some Facebook ads to test out the results let's talk about five different ways that chat gbt in its form today has helped my life in just the last couple weeks the first thing is that it's helped me write a resume in 2022 I actually closed my business that I worked on for four and a half years and it honestly created a huge confused spike in my life I just didn't really know know what to do and how to spend my time because a lot of that time spent in the last few years has been alone working on a project every single day so I'm getting a job now the problem with getting into a new career is that my resume is not really geared towards some of the jobs that I want for example I was writing a resume for a sales job and my friend told me that none of the things on my resume really talked about the sales experience that I gained in the entrepreneurial part of my life if you hear that it is raining like crazy here in California I pretty much use chat DBT to help me talk about some experiences that I had a hard time associating with sales experience that actually was sales experience but I couldn't really put it into words this is what my resume looked like before and this is what my resume looked like after and you can see if you pause the video that there is way better sales language in the second version of that the second thing is related to my health now I have a very specific diet and certain ingredients that I have to follow because I have early signs of Crohn's Disease if not I already have it so basically I'm only limited to certain kinds of foods otherwise I'll get sick and you know it just won't go down so what I did was I gave chat gbt a list of ingredients that I know are safe for me to eat and I told it to create some meal plans and ideas so that I can go and kind of change it up in the kitchen and prepare different foods that would actually be healthy for me I know a lot of people out there may not have specific diets but if you do know someone who has a specific diet or maybe you're cooking for your date who is vegan or gluten-free keto or whatever it is you can honestly probably rely on chat gbt to whip up some pretty good recipe ideas number three is giving me Product recommendations I recently am the new proud owner of a 2011 Subaru Outback and I'm obsessed with it I was looking for some all-terrain tires but I wanted to know which brand is known for what and which tires are recommended so I asked chat gbt what are the best all-terrain tires that they would recommend and actually gave me some pretty great ideas that I would then cross-reference with forums online and Reddit forums that would recommend the same types of products PS with product recommendations I still think it is way more reliable to go on Google tires is one thing but if you needed some actual Financial advice on you know which ETF to purchase you know based on how much money you have and all these other factors I just don't know if it's there yet although Maybe I'm Wrong now the last two are more business related if you have an online business you'll know what I'm talking about but number four is that chat gbt has helped me do keyword research for my blog now in the last two months I've been experimenting with a Blog that I started from scratch I spent 80 to 100 hours creating blog posts and making it a legitimately helpful resource and I have been teaching myself SEO essentially now if you're familiar with SEO you know that keyword research is one of the most important parts of the process of getting keywords to rank on Google on one hand you can use expensive tools like ahrefs to do that keyword research but you still have to come up with the idea of what keyword or Niche that you are looking into but that was a project that chat gbd helped me discover different keywords and different you know blog ideas that I would then go ahead and write lastly number five Chad GPT has helped me identify the problems that exist in health wealth and relationships just like I said in the beginning of this video recently I've been rereading this amazing book it's the 100 million dollar offer book by Alex ramosi and it's such a fundamentally awesome book for entrepreneurs and Espionage entrepreneurs and with the closing of my business about a year ago now I'm constantly looking around to see what are the biggest problems people are facing and which ones I'm qualified to help solve I took it upon myself to use Chad gbt to give me a little more insight and research on some of the most basic but very large problems people face in the most important parts of their lives I literally felt like I was having a conversation with Chachi Boutique about human problems I got to go pretty deep into the weeds and ask it for more detail and that is one of the best parts of chat gbt in my opinion I would give it some more parameters and it would give me better answers that are more niched down and I think it's very useful for people who are just getting started with the business or trying to come up with different ideas or problems that they can then go solve so those are the five different things that Chachi BT has helped me in the last couple weeks I think this obviously has a huge impact on the next 10 years I do think it's going to disrupt a lot of Industries but I also think that sometimes we allow these things to instill too much fear in us I hope you guys enjoyed watching this and if you haven't played with a chat GPT yet then go ahead and play with it I'll leave a link Down Below in the description so you can access it it's completely free I hope you guys have a great day and hopefully I will see you soon see ya specifically in the areas of Health we're not seeing something that is so threatening to our livelihood that we don't have a plan and if you don't have a plan get a plant because can't spell plant without a plan all right you can stay

so recently I watched this video by Greg Eisenberg right over here and I couldn't help but to notice after watching the video there were a lot of questions and I thought to myself well hey I own a directory that's successful uh it earns around $1,500 $2,000 a month and I'm also building for different directories as we speak so I'm really Allin on this directory game um I spent the last 9 months kind of fully invested like quit my job to fully go into this directory game to see how legit it is I figured I would spend some time answering some of the questions debunking some Skeptics but also just answering some of the really common questions cuz I see them all the time uh so if you watch this video or you are looking to build a website directory hopefully this will give you some good information on how to build a profitable website directory in 2025 so real quick I started my first website directory back in October of 20 2022 I was self teing myself SEO at the time just learning through YouTube and I built a website as just a way to practice what I learned let's see October by June 2023 so uh about 8 months about 8 months later this first website directory that I built um started making around like $1,000 to $1,200 a month like recurring gets around 50 to 60,000 monthly visitors and you can see here how much I earned quick note I said 2k a day because I also sell digital products on this directory website which is a whole thing I'm not even going to explain but um it is an extra angle once you get a lot of traffic to to a directory website uh but that accounts for about uh $400 to $500 a month on top of this all right so to be clear I'm going to be going through the comment section and just give me my two cents uh if you see any questions that I didn't answer um add them hello here's the first question that we saw what is the use of a business directory if chat gbt search will stop any traffic towards directories AI uses info from directories but the Searcher doesn't need to go to the directories information is given inside GPT search all clicks are basically stolen so what's the point basically depending on the kind of directory I would say I would be more nervous than others yeah the directories that I find are have the greatest hedge uh they're all location based my most successful directory if I told you the keyword you might think it's as easy as going to Google Maps and typing it in once you kind of go into the niche itself and the community and you look on Reddit you look on Tik Tok you just kind of start to do some social listening on the niche itself and you you start to realize wow it's like kind of hard to find these even when you type in Google Maps the queries that pop up are not accurate it pulls up all this kind of sort of junk that's not exactly what you're looking for so Google Maps is failing that them um they're asking for it on Tik Tok and Reddit and there's no like curated directory that just lists all the locations in a nice simple format uh we're talking Basics like store address hours um hours of operations phone number um and I like to add extra you know convenience uh so like reviews um an image of the outside it's a long-winded way to say that it depends on the directory the use of a business directory is sometimes as simple as solving for convenience uh that's the problem that you're solving right when you combine that with an underserved Niche that's getting 50,000 monthly clicks uh searches every single month it's it's it's a good opportunity it seems like directories are following the Yellow Pages book fate dude I know Yellow Pages was much bigger back then but Yellow Pages still gets millions and millions of monthly visitors so so people still use it don't underestimate the Boomers I've built a directory before and yes the potential revenue is not high but can be worth it for the most part yeah that's true it depends how you monetize it so I would say there's really two main ways people monetize directories the first one is display ads right you just have a ton of traffic and then you display uh you use eoic or mediavine ad sense these are all these different ways to monetize your directory with ads the second way is through selling featured or sponsored listings there is a very very well-known directory owner called Tim STDs um I think on YouTube he goes by stdy he's very transparent that his directory sober nation which is in the rehab Niche um he was selling uh featured listings for $129 a month and he had many many many many many rehabs pay him so at the height of his directory he was pulling in 250k a year you can definitely get there but it's really rare but I would agree the potential revenue is not super super high but um they could be pretty robust and they could kind of like stick onto Google for a while I haven't really worked on my website in months and it's continuing to get 50 60k a month in in monthly visitors okay so this guy John this is awesome question what is the best way to find the current directories that are out there to know if one already exists for the niche you're building in this is where I use atrs I mean it's it can be as simple as just Google searching it but what ATS allows you to do is look at all the different it first helps you understand all the different types of keywords um that are similar that might be getting way more search volume but effectively you could just go to Google and type in your Niche and just look for directory websites there are so many niches where directories already exist and they get no traffic uh very very little traffic that doesn't mean that you can't go and get traffic I mean I would say out of all five directories I've done a good amount of competitive research and most of them have competitors that are directories but when you look at it from an SEO lens and you start to look at their onpage SEO you start to analyze their backlink structure you just that that's what gives you confidence on whether or not you should kind of move forward or not um it's not whether or not current directories exist so it's like oh like I can't make one it's like nope like actually most directories they don't have great onpage SEO optimization um they don't do any backlinks which in my opinion aren't even necessary depending on the niche if you can't afford HFS or sem rush just look on Google and just like start clicking down to like the second or third page and look for directories that way um I will point out that if you do use all the tools he shows and throw 10 directories at the wall to Hope one works it's a minimum of $300 a month if you catch a fish grape but might be an expensive fishing pool I think Go's Groove is referring to just all the different softwares that are required to start a directory if you do it like John Rush did in the video Perhaps it is quite expensive but you can get started with just WordPress a domain and a theme when I built my first directory the one that has been monetizing for a year and a half um averaging 1,500 to 2,000 a month I quite literally copied and pasted I had Google Maps in one on one side of my screen and I had WordPress on the other side and I quite literally copied and pasted the store hours the phone numbers um the images literally all of that was so manually done because I had no idea of how to do it any faster the thing is like if you're committed to like increasing your monthly recurring revenue and having a digital asset that that makes money pretty passively then you don't have to spend that much money you can just get started the tools make it really really nice but when you're just starting you don't need to spend $300 a month uh let's see this guy says I don't want to sound like a hater because I can easily admit I'm wrong if the data shows it but I always raise an eye route to Good Samaritans on presenting the easy ways to make money if the powder is fresh tell your friends but not the public he's saying maybe we're too late for this ball game uh for instance would you risk going into Drop Shipping when there are a million influencers trying to sell their courses on it I see what this guy's saying yeah this guy is I kind of disagree with this Drop Shipping is just e-commerce man directories is just directories is really just formatting information in a way that Google prefers and that's kind of SEO too right I can see the frustration that this person has through through his words um but I also think that when you see a video like this you obviously don't copy the exact same Niche and kind of copy the same workflow what you should take away from this video um is that people are making money from it and you should give it a try if you want but maybe find your own Niche maybe find your own workflow like I would never make a directory in the AI tool space my directories are all super boring it's like porta potty rentals liquidation stores flea markets like stuff that is so boring and so it's just so boring like there's no other word to describe it but I've just found a way to do it I I I know what I'm looking at because I've done it before and I know it has a good chance of monetizing pretty decently so I guess what I'm saying is that directories work just like Drop Shipping still works but it's um it's not a it's not a it's not a get quick it's not a getrich quick scheme right it's um it's a it's an SEO focused kind of distribution first business model that takes months for reference my directories on average Take 6 months to start seeing like significant traffic in like the thousands like 5 to 10,000 range and then um you know even longer once you get to like 20,000 plus yeah like I guess if anything I'm proof that it works and I didn't know what the hell I was doing um I didn't listen to anyone's like process I kind of just tried it okay so this guy said okay so I create a directory say it's criminal lawyers near me just a dumb example how do I then populate the directory with businesses on this directory topic on day Zero okay so this is a really common question which is where do I get the data personally I use outs scraper but the answer is web scraping tools and I will actually log in so you can see what I'm talking about uh so real quick like this is I'm you know obviously I'm not sponsored but um I use out scraper there's so many other web scraping tools out there but for an example for criminal defense lawyer what was it criminal lawyers near me so basically what you want to do is use this scraper tool services by brand um Google and then Google Map scraper um so you can look up criminal lawyers like on Google Maps like I did and do you see how that text underneath the um the 4.7 and the five stars that's like an actual Google Maps um category so you can quite literally just use Criminal Justice attorney Sorry by clicking categories Criminal Justice attorney there it is and then from here you know you can choose which states that you want and then you can choose um you know if you want emails and you can even choose like if you want um the postal code the full street address if you want longitude ltitude so these are the ones that I choose which is why it's like defaulted to this but yeah so basically once you hit get data it'll give you an idea of how much it's going to cost so $53 to $353 it's usually less like it's usually on the lower end I should say but yeah you would just confirm that and then it would basically give you this uh the CSV file as you can see here I think yeah so this so this uh this CSV file has 61,000 rows so that's how you get the data you clean those 60 61,000 rows it's like a very tedious task just because it scrapes the data it doesn't mean it's super accurate you're you're going to get a lot of junk so you have to clean the data right you have to verify these are actually criminal attorney companies or whatnot and then once that happens then you could manually format it onto your website your WordPress website or do it programmatically but we're not going to get into it into that so by the way criminal lawyers probably so competitive I mean I would not go into that uh so a directory is a list of stuff it's just a list is that right what is a directory other than a list it's a list it's a Well curated list um that is optimized for onpage SEO right like your domain name has your keyword um your slug your header one tag your images alt text every single thing is optimized for SEO but it's a really good list for SEO uh that's that's the easy way to put it the validation process is that easy here only Google keywords planner I would not leave it up to only Google keywords planner I think it's a great free tool I would always go with HRS that's My Chosen tool for um honestly keyword research competitive research and backlink research the thing is that even with third party data like atrs you'll see a keyword that has 200,000 monthly uh Vis uh searches it'll say it's not very difficult to rank it's called keyword difficulty it will be like under 10 which is like very easy but it won't actually be easy to rank for because when you look at who's ranking for them the quality of their backlinks you want to check how many pages they have how much topical Authority they have I'm kind of going into the nerd Rabbit Hole of SEO but basically I would not just rely on Google Keyword Planner I would learn how to use tool called HRS or you can validate the overall interest uh through Reddit forums uh Tik Tok is really really good a culmination of all that should give you a decent idea of whether or not you can build this directory and get people to come visit what are some of the best examples of directories today um care.com Craigslist I mean those are two of the behemoths there's so many small directories that I find on a daily basis where they get like 20 to 60,000 monthly searches and they're probably making like $2 to $5,000 monthly passively but like they're in the weirdest niches that's what I'm saying it's like they're all in very very boring boring niches that you would never expect uh but those are the best examples I think care is doing like over 150 million in Revenue a year so um how to create an AI tools directory like futurepedia I would be very careful about an AI tool directory it depends on your goals right my goal with creating a directory is to have passive income like I want a I want a web asset that's going to make me passive money with a lot of time upfront and then very very very little time to maintain it I want it to be extremely high net margin I choose every niches I don't want to have to continue updating it every single month you know I don't mind spending like a few hours a month but it's just not my goal to like continue maintaining these if that makes sense this guy says he's been working on a directory as a side project um he uh I guess he's talking about John Rush finished one in 50 minutes and this guy feels like he needs to change my process this is a hot take but I actually I would actually rather spend a month or two months building out a directory and doing the proper research and like just making sure that I'm aiming at the right target I mean maybe the way he does it it's not that much work to just throw up a directory but I've done programmatic SEO directories and they just they just don't rank as well I'd be very curious to see anyone who who has crushed it with just a programmatic SEO directory the ones that have had the most success are all the static pages so 50 minutes is like stupid dude that's maybe he found a formula that works for him and maybe I'm just slow but personally I spend a month I spend two months working on a very nice directory so don't feel like you have to create one in 50 minutes okay yeah a lot of people are kind of like confused and they don't really believe it um maybe I'll make more videos on kind of the many different steps that are required to build a directory cuz based on this comment section A lot of people didn't really grasp the full step toep process um so maybe I'll make some more content around that but I think that's probably enough I mean I think I've been live for quite a while now those are all the questions that I'm going to answer for now this video is getting pretty long but if you are interested in building business directories um comment down below let me know I'm genuinely curious and if there are any questions that you have about this video or just business directories in general h at your boy just comment down below um and with that um thanks for watching appreciate it see you

what's up guys today i'm going to show you how to set up a simple email automation let's get it i don't know who needs to hear this but if you're not using email marketing in 2020 then you're missing out on some serious gains for your own business and one of my favorite things about email marketing is creating the email automations pretty much works while you sleep so without wasting any more time let's hop into the computer where i'm going to show you how to create a simple yet effective email automation let's do it all right guys we are officially in the computer and right now we are looking at my favorite email marketing software now it's important for me to say this before we start you don't need to be using convertkit but this is my favorite for reason and i did a video on it previously and you also don't need to necessarily use shopify you could be using squarespace you could be using wordpress but for the sake of this tutorial i'm going to be using convertkit and i'm going to be creating a landing page on my shopify website where i will then collect some emails and then it will initiate the welcome series or the email automation so that's what we're doing today and if you want to learn why i use convertkit go ahead and check out the video where i compare the email marketing softwares that i've used in my last three years and you'll have an idea of why i am so bullish on this brand right here so the first move is to create an account of course if you're just getting started with email marketing then you can go ahead and sign up for free once you've created an account you should be able to see a dashboard just like this so the first thing you do to start your email automation is actually create a landing page or a lead capture form now this can be found up on the top right you can just go ahead and click on that and here you can see i have one already made so what this form looks like on the actual website that i have is exactly like this so this is the clariform i created it and i embedded it into my shopify website which i will show you in a moment uh this is one of the stores that i manage is actually my father's company he sells vegan food my goal right here is just to collect people's information so that i can start to build a relationship with them and kind of figure out what people like what people want and what really drives my customers to go and purchase all right let's say for example that you just started email marketing and you don't have anything built yet the first step is to go ahead go into the landing pages and form section go ahead and create a new form and personally for this one i love the form and the reason i love the form is when you embed it into your website it's nice and clean just like the one that i embedded here if you were to choose the landing page you have all these beautiful templates here but what i think is the best way to capture emails and leads is to put it right where people are spending the most time which is in this case the shop now section so we're gonna go ahead and create the form and here you have four different types of forms so i'm gonna go ahead and click inline and here you can start to see a bunch of different templates that you have i'm a minimal person simple solutions are the best solutions for me so i'm going to go ahead and click claire which is the one that i have on my dad's website right now here we can start to see uh pretty much the blank slate you know you ask for your name your email address if you're wondering why i'm not collecting things like last name phone number it's because one i don't want to create a lot of friction when someone is signing up for my newsletter i want it to be quick and easy now one thing that you can do to make it a little bit more fun a little bit more appealing is you can change this subscribe button to something a little bit more engaging you can double click and then you can say something like join or maybe you can say get my free webinar now something like that so one other thing is i'm going to go ahead and click on this envelope thing and click this thing called auto confirm new subscribers because if you don't click it what happens is someone will sign up for your email newsletter and then receive a second email asking them to confirm their email and there's nothing wrong with that but in my experience a lot of people don't want to confirm their email so there ends up being this massive drop off on who is who is on your list i'm gonna go ahead and click save on the top right corner so now that we've created our little form we can go ahead and go to the top right where it says embed and here you have all these different strips of code in my case i use shopify and i can go ahead and just go to the html section even if you're using squarespace or wordpress you should be able to create an area where you put a custom html tag and you should be able to copy and paste this little paragraph of code in there and then start collecting some emails that way now one thing to note is you can go ahead and put this form in different parts of your website and what i mean by that is i'm going to go to this website which is the other website that i manage but here you can see like in every single product page that i have here i i've included it so how can we do this you ask let's go ahead and go into shopify i'm gonna go to the collections page which is under products and collections shop now is the spot now you can't just copy and paste it remember because we have this whole paragraph of html code so the way we do that is we go ahead and click on these two little brackets that say show html so i created a new collection so it's not so confusing go ahead and repeat that show html and then from here you should be able to paste that code which you got from convertkit and then click on this again voila you have your inline lead capture form so that's how you do it um and i'm not gonna go into it too much i'm gonna and i'm not even gonna save that so go back to convertkit real quick i'm just gonna change the name here to product page form all right and we're going to head over to the automations tab now here you can see i already have one but i'm going to go ahead and create a new automation from scratch so you know what i'm talking about you can browse a template there's a bunch of good ones but for the sake of this video i'm gonna go ahead and create an automation i know my goal is for people to sign up to this form right here and then once they click the subscribe button it lets my email automation to start releasing some emails so in order to do that let's go ahead and click joins a form and then choose the form that i want product page form this is the form that i just created from scratch which is this one right here this is the form make sure that the name matches the form that you are choosing go ahead and click add event so once we get to this step we can go ahead and click on the plus button and then i like to add the subscriber to a tag now this is one of the unique features about convertkit because this tag pretty much allows you to bucket your customers and kind of separate them into different interest categories based on what they like about your store this is especially effective on stores that have a lot of different products and you're trying to figure out which customers flock to which different products so i'm going to go ahead click on the action square and then click add or remove tag i actually want to create a new tag because for everyone who fills out this form i want to make sure to separate them into their own little category the way you can do that is go ahead and go to subscribers right here on the right side you can see that there's an option to create a tag so i pressed create a tag and i'm just going to go ahead and type newsletter opt-in and i'm going to go ahead and save that we're going to click the plus button here uh click add or remove tag and then we can choose the tag that we created called newsletter opt-in and then add this action go ahead and click the plus button and now we can do action again but this time we're going to choose an email sequence so just like we had to create a new tag for our newsletter opt-in we want to create a new sequence so we know what kind of content this subscriber has seen of ours so i don't show them the same content so the first thing we do is go back to the automations here you can see that there's another tab called sequences so go ahead and click on that we can create a new sequence and we just need to give this a name maybe it's called new subscribers go ahead and create the sequence and bam this is where you actually write and design the email chain the welcome series that a customer is going to receive once they opt into your your newsletter before we actually customize this we want to connect it to our automation so again let's go back to this automations area click the action here and then this time click email sequence go ahead and click on the email sequence that you just created which is called new subscribers right here go ahead and add that action and this is it guys just to kind of summarize what we just created every time someone fills out their information on this email form which we created it's gonna bucket them into this newsletter opt-in and then from here we're going to trigger a new subscribers sequence where if you're a new subscriber you can start to automate a sequence of emails where you can then start to sell your product get to know your your subscribers and all that kind of stuff the last step from here guys is the most time consuming part where you really want to spend a lot of time crafting a good email you just go ahead and click on the new subscribers box and then here you can start to create your emails this is our first email and you can type in say welcome to the fam right this is the first email they get when they sign up for your email newsletter and they can get it one day after they sign up or you can go ahead and change this by clicking the pencil button you can say that you want the customer to receive this message one hour after they sign up for your newsletter so here you can even choose which days you want them to send it because sometimes people don't check their emails as often on the weekends so let's say i wanted to check off saturday and sunday if this person did sign up for the email newsletter on a saturday they wouldn't receive that email or they wouldn't receive this welcome to the fam email until the following monday now this is awesome but this is just one email and we're here to create a welcome series so we want to go ahead and click add email maybe we even include a few different emails and this is where you can start to build that relationship and completely automate it here you can start to see that the default is one day after the way that they're going to receive this is that they sign up one hour later they they receive this email right here a day later they received this email a day later from that this one and then so on so forth but because you don't want to bombard them i personally don't like to send them an email every single day that seems like a little bit excessive and i know personally when i receive an email every single day from the same person trying to get to know me too quickly i tend to just unsubscribe really quickly yeah i'd like to hit them with an email one hour after they sign up so they don't forget me immediately and yeah i might hit them with another one the day after just you know maybe thanking them or introducing them to a product but after that i like to kind of give them some space on my third email sometimes i'll just say you know what i want them to receive the third email two days later in my opinion the best way to think about this automation series is to think about how you make friends in real life you know you don't just go up to someone random and just say hey can you buy my product can you buy my shoes can you buy my vegan food they need to kind of warm up to you as a person first maybe these first two emails are spent trying to find some common ground and either morals or values where you can stand on and then start to agree with that person for example my dad's vegan food business i know that the people who are joining this newsletter and are on this website are probably vegan or they're probably health conscious and they are looking for a meat alternative so i can use that information and create a compelling email where i pretty much say hey do you also look for meat like substances all i can tell you is don't sell too early and take your time to make sure that these first three or four emails lets the subscriber know that they're in the right place so that's it guys i hope you guys learned a thing or two and let me know how it goes for you when you're creating your own email automations in the comments below lastly if you like this stuff and you want me to talk about more stuff like this please hit that subscribe button or you can hit that like button and it's just good for my videos and my channel i appreciate it and i hope you guys have a wonderful day peace out

hey guys it's fray and today we are comparing Shopify Squarespace and WordPress it's 20/20 and the time to start an online business or trying to make some money online through the internet has never been better I figured I would kind of share my experience with making multiple websites with each of these platforms and which platform might be the best for you keep in mind that this is coming from someone who has zero coding experience I don't know any of the you know HTML and CSS that's gonna make you a fully customizable website so let's get to it we're gonna dive into the pros and cons of each of these three platforms and I'm gonna kind of recommend what I believe is best based on what kind of business you have whether you have a blog or you're trying to do affiliate marketing whether you're an e-commerce store whether you have a professional service consulting maybe that you're trying to sell I think this is valid for all of those different businesses and these are some things to consider as you're choosing first Squarespace you've probably heard of Squarespace over the years because they are really aggressive in their marketing tactics especially when kind of sponsoring podcasts and different YouTube channels so the pros that I've had with Squarespace are definitely the price it's definitely a great deal I just started a Squarespace website last week and I believe I paid a little bit over $100 for one entire year I also used the extension honey which is a free Chrome extension that helps find different promo codes and coupon codes and it gave me a 20% discount so that was pretty sweet the second thing is that there's no coding knowledge necessary it's really easy to learn I think that if you have general knowledge with tech then you could figure out Squarespace in a matter of a couple of days I remember when I started back in 2013 it was still a little bit clunky and it still only took me I think one entire long day to figure out how to start building my website another thing is they offer a free domain for one year and usually a domain will cost about $14.99 years so you can consider that into your savings that's pretty cool lastly I would say Squarespace is pretty big at this point so it's pretty easy to find tutorials online on how to build your website or something specific it's pretty likely you'll be able to look it up on YouTube and just figure out the answer from there their customer support is also pretty good they have a ticket system where you can just write them an email and then they'll get back to you in a couple of days I personally love the phone support I feel like that's the quickest way for me to get my answers now I'm gonna talk about a couple things where a Squarespace might be lacking just a little bit the first one is the plugins now for me I own an e-commerce store and having the right plugins can seriously enhance their customer experience so much that it could lead to a lot more sales it could just lead to a better impression while Squarespace does allow you to install third-party plugins there's not a dedicated plug-in store where you can kind of see which popular plugins there are and what the reviews are now just a heads up plugins are definitely more important for e-commerce stores I would say and it's totally worth kind of weighing your option when choosing one of these platforms I would recommend Squarespace for anyone who is doing a personal blog or a business blog affiliate marketing you know you have products maybe you're trying to do some kind of affiliate marketing with Amazon or some other company and you want to promote it or if you have a service business you know a photography business a consulting business maybe you do graphic design as a freelancer all these things I think are a really solid option for Squarespace number two is Shopify Shopify is what I currently use for my e-commerce store and I'm use them for the last two-and-a-half to three years since I have so much experience with Shopify I'm gonna go ahead and say I recommend Shopify for any smaller medium-sized business especially if they're selling a physical product their interface is also pretty straightforward and really quick to build once you figure out in fact just a couple months ago I was playing around with drop shipping and I learned Shopify so that I was making websites in about three hours that looked pretty decent the next one I think is the most important which is customer support Shopify has a dedicated phone number where you can call and ask them anything that you are having troubles with as someone whose business relies on e-commerce I feel like this is so crucial because I can pick up the phone and get a solution and right around 30 minutes to 45 minutes as opposed to Squarespace that might take one or two business days and I'm the kind of guy who would call up support for something that I might be even just a little bit lazy to look up or do and every single experience I've had with Shopify customer support has been really positive and I got my answer in that call the third thing is Shopify has its own dedicated Shopify add-on or plug-in store when you realize the power of plugins you will absolutely love this because there's almost a plug-in for anything that you want to do if you want to completely edit every single part of your website there's definitely a plug-in for that if you want reviews underneath your products there's a plugin for that if you want a plug-in that compresses every single image to make it SEO friendly there's a plugin for that and so there's literally thousands of these plugins what's even better is that there are multiple reviews that you can read and you can see if the developers behind these plugins are really keeping up to date and making new innovations all right now let's talk about the disadvantages of using Shopify the first one being the price the lowest package starts at $29 a month I feel like this is a little bit pricey especially if you are unsure whether or not you are gonna monetize it maybe you're just starting a blog for fun and you just want a place to write and have your art live in a place so in that case I feel like $29 is a little bit steep the second disadvantage I I can think of it's not fully customizable and what I mean by that is that there are certain parts of making a website on Shopify there are just a little bit in the meeting with Shopify you pretty much buy a theme whatever the template is what you're working with so in short it's less customizable but then again there are plugins for that and while the plugins do cost money sometimes especially if they're very solid plugins it's worth it the last one is WordPress first things that I think about when I think of WordPress is like it kind of gives me a headache but also the ceiling is absolutely limitless and with that said one of the biggest pros of WordPress is its customizable function you can totally buy a template and make your life easier just by putting in your photos and changing the text and kind of doing it like Shopify and Squarespace but I feel like WordPress this interface is probably the least friendly of them all the second thing that's great for WordPress is that it's a very SEO friendly right out of the box if that just sounded like a jumbled sentence to you SEO stands for search engine optimization and it's pretty much the art of getting your website visible on Google's you know home page you know obviously if you're the first link when you type in haircuts near me you're gonna get more business than the person who's on the third page or the fourth page basically if you know absolutely zero about SEO and you start a Squarespace website and a WordPress website about the same industries the same topics and you have the same kind of content and everything your website may have a chance to be a little bit more visible and get more traction but just by a little bit the third advantage of WordPress is that there are a ton of plugins there's something called the Envato marketplace where there are literally hundreds of different templates that you can choose from for WordPress and it's honestly pretty beautiful like any single kind of website that you can imagine is probably available there and because WordPress has so many different templates it makes it very very versatile and honestly the right choice when it comes to creating any sort of business but now let's get into the cons of WordPress because there are definitely some disadvantages for a non tech savvy person like me my first complaint is WordPress's support now WordPress doesn't have a phone where you can call them and ask a dedicated WordPress rep for help and because they don't have an in-house customer service that I can just call I oftentimes have to rely on YouTube tutorials and forums online to get the answers that I need it could be very challenging to find that answer because like I said there are so many different kind of themes and plugins available the second con of WordPress in my opinion is the user interface since I've been making websites for about seven years give or take I feel like WordPress this interface is probably the least friendly of them all took me a really long time just to figure out how to do very basic things that would have been very very straightforward on Squarespace or Shopify even though WordPress has the highest ceiling when it comes to being with a customize your own website it just kind of gives me a headache just thinking about what I'll have to learn and what I'd have to do to really create the website that I would be happy with so that's the only thing I have against WordPress otherwise I would highly recommend WordPress for any maybe small medium or large business that needs a fully customizable website maybe they need a very specific function like if you're a restaurant you need some kind of dinner reservation being that you hire these engineers you know pay them tens of thousands of dollars for another instance where I would totally recommend learning WordPress for is if you go into the business of creating websites for other people personally I have a friend who learned WordPress in a matter of three months and he was kind of like a wizard WordPress person he actually ended up turning it into his first business where he would create these WordPress businesses and sell them for like two or three thousand dollars and honestly that was four or five years ago but it is still a need today and there's a lot of people who would be willing to purchase a website and just pay someone to do it alright I think that's it I hope this is a little bit valuable and hope you can narrow down your decision on which platform to use when you're booting your own website if you got value out of this video I would really appreciate it if you just gave this video a thumbs up it helps my videos be see by more people and I'm trying to do this YouTube grind so help me up and that's all I ask in return so have a wonderful week and I guess I'll see you guys next time peace out

so lately i've been scrolling tick tock and been seeing this resource called copy.ai everywhere they claim it to be a huge time saver for writing copy whether it be for your blog post your facebook ads whatever it might be we're gonna go check it out so this is gonna be a review but also a test to see if the ad copy performs better than an actual person writing it that's what we're doing today i'm super excited because i've seen the hype i know it's a relatively new company and i love reviewing softwares let's dive into it and let's check it out okay so right off the bat ad copy simplified compose high performing audience based ad copy in seconds i love to hear that we got a little demo here okay cool this is a really solid website by the way so i'm going to go ahead and start a free trial here and i'm just going to sign up real quick all right welcome getting a few things set up for your disclaimers for success all the outputs are generated by ai oh wow they have product descriptions as well okay so this ai is not just for ad copy then it's for all sorts of other things which is really cool we're here for the facebook primary text because that is what i wanted to test so we're going to go ahead and create this the name of your brand or product i'm going to put i'm gonna be testing this for my vegan leather footwear brand which is called tastemaker supply but instead of using that name i'm gonna put vegan leather shoes i think it'll just relate more pretty much everything that i included in this paragraph is something that i would include in a facebook ad now it's time that we test this out so in three two one make copy now typically it doesn't take me that long to actually oh okay okay right off the bat we got a lot of different copy so let's look at the first one good style a better experience we build vegan leather shoes with the environment in mind it's scratch resistant water resistant and guaranteed not to crack or peel for uh in 10 plus years that is pretty good i'm gonna heart that okay right off the bat let me just say that the first four or five that i've read have zero grammatical or spelling issues i haven't even mentioned my family's most groundbreaking charming intelligent robot me tastemaker was born when founder your ghost marco polos wanted to make more from his shoes i have no idea where that came from dude i don't even know who this guy is is this guy even a real person dude let's check dude i don't even think this is a real person um if you want to change the world but can't fasten your shoes then tastemaker is the brand for you that's funny vegan leather shoes made to fit every occasion from 79 usd i wonder if they pulled this from our website probably i bet they did i bet they did because how else would they be able to know that i'm gonna give this a four stars and the reason why i'm giving it four stars is because i'm blown away by first of all just basics right spelling grammar the variety of different copies um the different types of approach that they're giving you to write a facebook ad copy this is really really solid the reason why i'm not giving it five stars is because i noticed a couple places where they used words i didn't input like recycled there's one where the the sentence is incomplete there's just some small things right this this this random founder name out of these i think there's probably 15 or so three of them really stand out to me and what i'm looking for is a way for for this copy to hook people in because i'm going to use this as cold traffic copy which is for people who have never heard of my brand before let's try it out with some real facebook ads shall we now's the time we actually get to test this copy against my facebook ads that are currently running and i'm super excited for this because one of them in particular i really want to test is this one looking for a perfect pair of vegan leather shoes sometime back we were just like you on the hunt for a pair of truly high quality vegan leather shoes that search led us to great taste maker shoes a taste maker we have perfected our craft of creating quality vegan leather shoes that are as close to their animal counterparts as possible so what i'm going to do is i'm going to take my prospecting campaign for women it has just over 4x return on ad spend so what i'm going to do is i'm just going to copy the campaign keep everything the same i'm going to target these four interests i'm going to use the same creative and we're going to come back in a couple days and check out what the results are look at a couple metrics and see if there was any difference using the copy.ai ad copy all right i'm back and it's november 17th which means it's been two days since my new campaign has been running with the copy.ai facebook copy so let's dive right into the numbers and look at the two campaigns to see which one performed better so in order to judge it fairly what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna pull up the data for the first two days of my original campaign and compare that to the the two days for the copy.ai campaign and that way we can kind of see from the beginning results which one is kind of on its way to success for this one we can see that this resulted in five purchases the cost per result was 36 dollars and 12 cents that's not bad you know five five purchases for 180 dollars 36 dollars per cost result is actually pretty good now let's look at the copy.ai campaign and see what the results were so here is the copy.ai data and we spent a total of 188.52 cents the results were two purchases at a cost per result of 94 dollars and 26 cents obviously from this we can say that even from the beginning the campaign where i created and copyright everything it performed better it performed better it got more purchases and did it at a lower cost per result so the big question is is copy.ai worth it and do these results mean that copy.ai is not worth it should you just learn copywriting by yourself well first of all i imagine that copy.ai is a resource for people who don't have the time to optimize a facebook description and think about what they should write you know the truth is with my original campaign it took me probably 10 minutes to write this maybe even less and i'm not trying to say that to brag i'm saying that all i did was have a really deep understanding of what my customers always ask and i just put that in caption form i guess what i'm saying is that there's nothing that can truly beat a human's understanding of their customers you know two or three years of experience talking to my customers in real life online on social media i've talked to literally hundreds of people hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of my customers and over time i've just developed this understanding of what my customers ask and what they always need with that said copy.ai in my opinion i'm still a big fan of you are saving a ton of time the actual caption itself is pretty damn good you know based on my personal experience and what i know to be true about people's attention spans and copywriting as a skill this is a good caption i think what would really buff it up is if you added your own line breaks and you added some emojis maybe to kind of ease the eyes make it so it's not one big block of text that you just have to read through then i think this would be a really really strong facebook description it definitely has a huge use in the market especially for people who don't have time to make descriptions and write blogs and all these different things it does a pretty damn good job of crafting a long form piece of text that is pretty much very very relevant to your brand this is a great tool for people who are just starting their business and might not have all the knowledge and experience of talking to their customers and interacting with them they're just getting started of course you don't understand your customer needs you haven't talked to them enough and you haven't talked to enough of them in general i would say it's also a great tool for people who are very busy maybe they're releasing you know five blogs a week or constantly changing all sorts of ad copy and testing it at a very very high level it's also super helpful for people who don't want to hire a digital marketer and they just want to hire an ai robot because at the end of the day the ai robot is going to produce highly relevant text it's going to save you the time to train and manage someone if you actually were to onboard them and it's only 99 a month which might sound expensive if you're a startup or you know something like that but 99 a month can be super worth it especially considering that they're able to produce facebook descriptions blogs just blogs alone would probably be worth the 99 a month i would say if you're on the fence of trying copy.ai i would say go ahead and try it out and even run some ad campaigns just like me because you might have different results they have a seven day free trial so i would take advantage of that my final thoughts on this is that the best way that you can use a tool like copy.ai is if you understand what a good caption looks like and you have a deep understanding of what your customers want to hear and the language they want to use and you use copy.ai and together you can craft these beautiful little blog babies or facebook description babies that are super optimized because this gave me a lot of ideas that i don't think i would have thought of that i could turn into something that would be highly effective so that's pretty much it um really fun video here i really enjoyed this i love reviewing new softwares or even old softwares that can improve your workflow so if you have any recommendations on your favorite plugins softwares apps whatever it might be please include them in the comment down below and i'll find a way to create some content around it with that guys i think that about wraps it up if you enjoyed this video my only favor is to give me a thumbs up because it allows me to get this content out to people who might want to use it or might find it entertaining hope you guys have a great week and see you next time peace

hey guys today I'm going to show you Shogun page motor one of my favorite apps of all time I use this on my website right here we can see we're on this website here this is my main store and I use the Shogun page builder to create a highly effective product page when you do you buy a theme on Shopify most of the times it doesn't meet all of your needs sometimes you want to make some design changes and you just don't have that option so that's where I use Shogun page builder in this video I'm going to show you how I create a product page by actually building one that I've been meaning to do on my store today I'm going to be converting this regular old average Joe product page to one that I believe is going to convert more customers and get more sales for your store we have our photo we have the sizes a little description of the product here but then it just kind of ends and there's nothing more to see and if there's anything I learned about creating better product pages over the years is that we want to add more visuals you want to add main selling points if you can't describe the main selling points of your product then that's gonna be some trouble without going too deep into my own business my main selling point with my shoes is that I am cruelty free meaning I use like a leather list product that looks like leather and I also try to focus on comfort and durability so with that said I'm going to use those selling points and then include more of a experience for my customers to browse through when they land on this page and just to show you what the final product will look like I do have this page it's a men's boot that I also sell and here we see we have our typical page here we have some reviews but then we dive into this this little section at the end it just lists the main selling points that I like the customer to know and lastly I added a call to action on the end because that's always good practice when you want to sell something because overall the more engagement you can make with the customer the better it's gonna be for you I think Shogun page motor is really effective when you're selling any kind of physical product especially apparel and this is honestly this is a premium price you know $39 a month buys you a gym membership $39 a month gets you Netflix and all that stuff so why am I so bullish on installing Shogun well you're gonna find that this $39 a month paired with the right Facebook and Instagram ad strategy it's gonna be you know very much birthday so this is what you're gonna see when you download Shogun page builder you're not gonna have all these products of course it's gonna be blank so one of my favorite things about Shogun is that it helps you measure the sales that you get from this app alone so and I'm gonna click on this little bar chart right here we can see what kind of devices people plan on our website with here we can see almost 80% of the people go on mobile so now I kind of know okay I need to optimize my customer experience for people who are scrolling on the phone in the last 7 days I already paid off my monthly fee for the actual app so that's really cool if you want to see more of your metrics you can't upgrade your plan we're gonna go ahead and create a page now you have an option to create whatever page you want but in this case the product page is where it's at so I'm gonna go ahead and do that type in the product to start searching we're gonna be working off the taste affection boot and we want to customize this there it goes it pops up then it asks us do you want a custom layout or an existing layout I'm gonna go ahead and click the existing layout because I still want to keep all of my product page here I just want to add some more visuals on the bottom of the page so I'm gonna go ahead and create an existing layout and then click create page we can actually start designing our product page now so here we can see we have our existing template we have all these different elements on the side that we can use to customize our page it keeps going down and down we even have some templates here if you don't feel like you're very strong in website design go ahead and use one of these templates because they're here and they look pretty damn good so the template that I like to use for my product pages is called value prop large and it's right here kind of towards the bottom and I'm just gonna go ahead and grab it and drop it in this little column right here and then it's gonna populate this template pretty much where I can then go ahead and change the photos one great thing you can do to check that it's mobile-friendly is simply go to the top bar right here and here we can see how it would look with different devices so let's go ahead give it the mobile view so with the mobile view we can scroll down and see how it would look with our new product page so right now it's looking pretty groovy with this new plugin installed we already can see that the customer will have a way better experience just scrolling down and especially if you know what questions the customers will have before they buy then you can go ahead and answer those questions and then you've got a way better chance at selling things I'm actually going to delete this right now the reason is I actually saved my template from my previous shogun pages that i've built because once you build a product page like this once then you could go ahead and save it by going to the right hand side clicking save styles and click save new style and it's gonna save all of these different elements for you go on the right hand side where it says saved and here i have saved all the different little sections so i can simply drag and drop these to my product page so I'm pretty much finished building my page all I have to do right now is switch out the photos but I'm going to show you something real quick which is how to change the color of a button or a heading right here because as you can see right now this little bright purple doesn't quite match with this dark purple that I want to match I simply click on the element and then here we have this control panel and a Styles panel I'm simply gonna scroll all the way down to the submit button and here we can see the background color is that light purple I'm just gonna paste the code for the same color here just to make it you know similar it just makes the website like more professional and there we can see that it looks very good now we are going to swap out these little product images for something that actually matches the shoe go down to background you can go ahead and trash this and then I'm gonna pick an image from my computer there it is that looks pretty good right off the bat quick mobile view BAM right there let's go back to the desktop view and then change this one and then we're gonna pick another image I have chosen this one as my second one and here is my third image right over here if the photo here looks like it is being cut off I wouldn't worry too much just go to your mobile view and make sure that it looks good on a smartphone because you'd rather make a great experience for those 80% of website visitors that are coming on a phone then like that 20% who are coming on a desktop majority rules right to see this photo just fixed itself once you've changed it to mobile view and it looks a lot better you're pretty much selling the product in a better way but what makes this super effective is when you actually combine it with a Facebook or Instagram ad strategy or with Shogun Page booter you can now make your product page the landing page the product that they're interested is right in front of them and there's a compelling reason why they should buy it that's pretty much it I'm gonna go ahead and hit save and then I'm gonna hit publish because I think it's pretty much ready and now BAM there it is these are all of our cool new photos I probably can't add another little section with customer testimonials but this is looking pretty damn good so that is the power of Shogun and remember guys Shogun isn't just used to make a really great product page you can go ahead and create a new blog post where there's a bunch of different templates that you can use see here there's a blogs collection pages yeah there's a lot of great templates here there's landing pages product pages there's all sorts of cool templates for you to use that kind of give you a place to start if you want to get started with Shogun go ahead and click the link down below this isn't affiliate link so I do get a small commission for you know sending you there if you purchase the product but other than that I'll cut you guys in the next video peace
